TI  - Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for Interoperability in Health 
      Research: Systematic Review.
PG  - e35724
LID - 10.2196/35724 [doi]
LID - e35724
AB  - BACKGROUND: The standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is 
      widely used in health information technology. However, its use as a standard for 
      health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more 
      efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly 
      important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as "Public 
      Health & Research" and "Evidence-Based Medicine" while using already established 
      web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different 
      data sources and improve interoperability in health research. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and 
      determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and 
      possible future directions. METHODS: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web 
      of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published 
      from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were 
      included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and 
      expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study 
      with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures. 
      RESULTS: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible 
      for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical 
      research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology 
      (6%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20%, n=10). Studies used FHIR 
      for data capture (29%, n=14), standardization of data (41%, n=20), analysis (12%, 
      n=6), recruitment (14%, n=7), and consent management (4%, n=2). Most (55%, 27/49) 
      of the studies had a generic approach, and 55% (12/22) of the studies focusing on 
      specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, 
      environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their 
      solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63%, 31/49) of the studies 
      reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature 
      of Medicine Clinical Terms (29%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and 
      Codes (37%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18%, 
      n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12%, n=6), 
      and others (43%, n=21). Only 4 (8%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain 
      "Public Health & Research." Limitations using FHIR included the possible change 
      in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR 
      server. CONCLUSIONS: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health 
      research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use 
      cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other 
      standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data 
      model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of 
      FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be 
      addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, 
      interoperability in health research.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI220477 [doi]
AB  - In a national effort aiming at cross-hospitals data interoperability, the Swiss 
      Personalized Health Network elected RDF as preferred data and meta-data 
      representation format. Yet, most clinical research software solutions are not 
      designed to interact with RDF databases. We present a modular Python toolkit 
      allowing easy conversion from RDF graphs to i2b2, adaptable to other common data 
      models (CDM) with reasonable efforts. The tool was designed with feedback from 
      clinicians in both oncology and laboratory research.

TI  - CASIDE: A data model for interoperable cancer survivorship information based on 
      FHIR.
PG  - 103953
LID - S1532-0464(21)00282-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103953 [doi]
AB  - Cancer survivorship has traditionally received little research attention although 
      it is associated with a variety of long-term consequences and also many other 
      comorbidities. There is an urgent need to increase research on this area, and the 
      secondary use of healthcare data has the potential to provide valuable insights 
      on survivors' health trajectories. However, cancer survivors' data is often 
      stored in silos and collected inconsistently. In this study we present CASIDE, an 
      interoperable data model for cancer survivorship information that aims to 
      accelerate the secondary use of healthcare data and data sharing across 
      institutions. It is designed to provide a holistic view of the cancer survivor, 
      taking into account not just the clinical data but also the patient's own 
      perspective, and is built upon the emerging Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast 
      Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Advantages of adopting 
      FHIR and challenges in information modelling using this standard are discussed. 
      CASIDE is a generalizable approach that is already being used as a support tool 
      for the development of downstream applications to support clinical decision 
      making and can contribute to translational collaborative research on cancer 
      survivorship.

TI  - Modeling and integration of N-glycan biomarkers in a comprehensive biomarker data 
      model.
PG  - 855-870
LID - 10.1093/glycob/cwac046 [doi]
AB  - Molecular biomarkers measure discrete components of biological processes that can 
      contribute to disorders when impaired. Great interest exists in discovering early 
      cancer biomarkers to improve outcomes. Biomarkers represented in a standardized 
      data model, integrated with multi-omics data, may improve the understanding and 
      use of novel biomarkers such as glycans and glycoconjugates. Among altered 
      components in tumorigenesis, N-glycans exhibit substantial biomarker potential, 
      when analyzed with their protein carriers. However, such data are distributed 
      across publications and databases of diverse formats, which hamper their use in 
      research and clinical application. Mass spectrometry measures of 50 N-glycans on 
      7 serum proteins in liver disease were integrated (as a panel) into a cancer 
      biomarker data model, providing a unique identifier, standard nomenclature, links 
      to glycan resources, and accession and ontology annotations to standard protein, 
      gene, disease, and biomarker information. Data provenance was documented with a 
      standardized United States Food and Drug Administration-supported BioCompute 
      Object. Using the biomarker data model allows the capture of granular 
      information, such as glycans with different levels of abundance in cirrhosis, 
      hepatocellular carcinoma, and transplant groups. Such representation in a 
      standardized data model harmonizes glycomics data in a unified framework, making 
      glycan-protein biomarker data exploration more available to investigators and to 
      other data resources. The biomarker data model we describe can be used by 
      researchers to describe their novel glycan and glycoconjugate biomarkers; it can 
      integrate N-glycan biomarker data with multi-source biomedical data and can 
      foster discovery and insight within a unified data framework for glycan biomarker 
      representation, thereby making the data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, 
      Interoperable, Reusable) (https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

TI  - Edible Matrix Code with Photogenic Silk Proteins.
PG  - 513-526
LID - 10.1021/acscentsci.1c01233 [doi]
AB  - Counterfeit medicines are a healthcare security problem, posing not only a direct 
      threat to patient safety and public health but also causing heavy economic 
      losses. Current anticounterfeiting methods are limited due to the toxicity of the 
      constituent materials and the focus of secondary packaging level protections. We 
      introduce an edible, imperceptible, and scalable matrix code of information 
      representation and data storage for pharmaceutical products. This matrix code is 
      digestible as it is composed of silk fibroin genetically encoded with fluorescent 
      proteins produced by ecofriendly, sustainable silkworm farming. Three distinct 
      fluorescence emission colors are incorporated into a multidimensional parameter 
      space with a variable encoding capacity in a format of matrix arrays. This code 
      is smartphone-readable to extract a digitized security key augmented by a deep 
      neural network for overcoming fabrication imperfections and a cryptographic hash 
      function for enhanced security. The biocompatibility, photostability, thermal 
      stability, long-term reliability, and low bit error ratio of the code support the 
      immediate feasibility for dosage-level anticounterfeit measures and 
      authentication features. The edible code affixed to each medicine can serve as 
      serialization, track and trace, and authentication at the dosage level, 
      empowering every patient to play a role in combating illicit pharmaceuticals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The diversity of nomenclature and naming strategies makes therapeutic 
      terminology difficult to manage and harmonize. As the number and complexity of 
      available therapeutic ontologies continues to increase, the need for harmonized 
      cross-resource mappings is becoming increasingly apparent. This study creates 
      harmonized concept mappings that enable the linking together of like-concepts 
      despite source-dependent differences in data structure or semantic 
      representation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we created Thera-Py, a 
      Python package and web API that constructs searchable concepts for drugs and 
      therapeutic terminologies using 9 public resources and thesauri. By using a 
      directed graph approach, Thera-Py captures commonly used aliases, trade names, 
      annotations, and associations for any given therapeutic and combines them under a 
      single concept record. RESULTS: We highlight the creation of 16 069 unique merged 
      therapeutic concepts from 9 distinct sources using Thera-Py and observe an 
      increase in overlap of therapeutic concepts in 2 or more knowledge bases after 
      harmonization using Thera-Py (9.8%-41.8%). CONCLUSION: We observe that Thera-Py 
      tends to normalize therapeutic concepts to their underlying active ingredients 
      (excluding nondrug therapeutics, eg, radiation therapy, biologics), and unifies 
      all available descriptors regardless of ontological origin.

LID - 107
AB  - BACKGROUND: The decreasing cost of obtaining high-quality calls of genomic 
      variants and the increasing availability of clinically relevant data on such 
      variants are important drivers for personalized oncology. To allow rational 
      genome-based decisions in diagnosis and treatment, clinicians need intuitive 
      access to up-to-date and comprehensive variant information, encompassing, for 
      instance, prevalence in populations and diseases, functional impact at the 
      molecular level, associations to druggable targets, or results from clinical 
      trials. In practice, collecting such comprehensive information on genomic 
      variants is difficult since the underlying data is dispersed over a multitude of 
      distributed, heterogeneous, sometimes conflicting, and quickly evolving data 
      sources. To work efficiently, clinicians require powerful Variant Information 
      Systems (VIS) which automatically collect and aggregate available evidences from 
      such data sources without suppressing existing uncertainty. METHODS: We address 
      the most important cornerstones of modeling a VIS: We take from emerging 
      community standards regarding the necessary breadth of variant information and 
      procedures for their clinical assessment, long standing experience in 
      implementing biomedical databases and information systems, our own clinical 
      record of diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients based on molecular profiles, 
      and extensive literature review to derive a set of design principles along which 
      we develop a relational data model for variant level data. In addition, we 
      characterize a number of public variant data sources, and describe a data 
      integration pipeline to integrate their data into a VIS. RESULTS: We provide a 
      number of contributions that are fundamental to the design and implementation of 
      a comprehensive, operational VIS. In particular, we (a) present a relational data 
      model to accurately reflect data extracted from public databases relevant for 
      clinical variant interpretation, (b) introduce a fault tolerant and performant 
      integration pipeline for public variant data sources, and (c) offer 
      recommendations regarding a number of intricate challenges encountered when 
      integrating variant data for clincal interpretation. CONCLUSION: The analysis of 
      requirements for representation of variant level data in an operational data 
      model, together with the implementation-ready relational data model presented 
      here, and the instructional description of methods to acquire comprehensive 
      information to fill it, are an important step towards variant information systems 
      for genomic medicine.

TI  - BRIDG: a domain information model for translational and clinical protocol-driven 
      research.
PG  - 882-890
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocx004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is critical to integrate and analyze data from biological, 
      translational, and clinical studies with data from health systems; however, 
      electronic artifacts are stored in thousands of disparate systems that are often 
      unable to readily exchange data. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate meaningful data 
      exchange, a model that presents a common understanding of biomedical research 
      concepts and their relationships with health care semantics is required. The 
      Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) domain information model 
      fulfills this need. Software systems created from BRIDG have shared meaning 
      "baked in," enabling interoperability among disparate systems. For nearly 10 
      years, the Clinical Data Standards Interchange Consortium, the National Cancer 
      Institute, the US Food and Drug Administration, and Health Level 7 International 
      have been key stakeholders in developing BRIDG. METHODS: BRIDG is an open-source 
      Unified Modeling Language-class model developed through use cases and 
      harmonization with other models. RESULTS: With its 4+ releases, BRIDG includes 
      clinical and now translational research concepts in its Common, Protocol 
      Representation, Study Conduct, Adverse Events, Regulatory, Statistical Analysis, 
      Experiment, Biospecimen, and Molecular Biology subdomains. INTERPRETATION: The 
      model is a Clinical Data Standards Interchange Consortium, Health Level 7 
      International, and International Standards Organization standard that has been 
      utilized in national and international standards-based software development 
      projects. It will continue to mature and evolve in the areas of clinical imaging, 
      pathology, ontology, and vocabulary support. BRIDG 4.1.1 and prior releases are 
      freely available at https://bridgmodel.nci.nih.gov .

TI  - State-of-the-Art Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-Based Data 
      Model and Structure Implementations: Systematic Scoping Review.
PG  - e58445
LID - 10.2196/58445 [doi]
LID - e58445
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data models are crucial for clinical research as they enable 
      researchers to fully use the vast amount of clinical data stored in medical 
      systems. Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are 
      necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would 
      be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data 
      availability for research. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to provide a 
      comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in 
      FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and 
      discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned 
      in the selected research papers. METHODS: To ensure the extraction of reliable 
      results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) 
      checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, 
      IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, 
      extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we 
      synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and 
      variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different 
      studies. RESULTS: On the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main 
      themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also 
      categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and 
      infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general 
      medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or 
      common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included 
      FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage 
      and security. The most common resource was "Observation" followed by "Condition" 
      and "Patient." The limitations and challenges of developing data models were 
      categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, 
      standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: 
      FHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing 
      real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic 
      health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of 
      data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, 
      FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for 
      systems and data warehouses across different settings. However, ongoing efforts 
      to address existing limitations and challenges are essential for the successful 
      implementation and integration of FHIR data models.

TI  - Recommendations for the collection and annotation of biosamples for analysis of 
      biomarkers in neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis clinical trials.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis 1 and schwannomatosis are characterized by 
      potential lifelong morbidity and life-threatening complications. To date, 
      however, diagnostic and predictive biomarkers are an unmet need in this patient 
      population. The inclusion of biomarker discovery correlatives in 
      neurofibromatosis 1/schwannomatosis clinical trials enables study of 
      low-incidence disease. The implementation of a common data model would further 
      enhance biomarker discovery by enabling effective concatenation of data from 
      multiple studies. METHODS: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and 
      Schwannomatosis biomarker working group reviewed published data on emerging 
      trends in neurofibromatosis 1 and schwannomatosis biomarker research and 
      developed recommendations in a series of consensus meetings. RESULTS: Liquid 
      biopsy has emerged as a promising assay for neurofibromatosis 1/schwannomatosis 
      biomarker discovery and validation. In addition, we review recommendations for a 
      range of biomarkers in clinical trials, neurofibromatosis 
      1/schwannomatosis-specific data annotations, and common data models for data 
      integration. CONCLUSION: These Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and 
      Schwannomatosis consensus guidelines are intended to provide best practices for 
      the inclusion of biomarker studies in neurofibromatosis 1/schwannomatosis 
      clinical trials, data, and sample annotation and to lay a framework for data 
      harmonization and concatenation between trials.

TI  - Standardized data sharing in a paediatric oncology research network--a 
      proof-of-concept study.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - Data that has been collected in the course of clinical trials are potentially 
      valuable for additional scientific research questions in so called secondary use 
      scenarios. This is of particular importance in rare disease areas like paediatric 
      oncology. If data from several research projects need to be connected, so called 
      Core Datasets can be used to define which information needs to be extracted from 
      every involved source system. In this work, the utility of the Clinical Data 
      Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Operational Data Model (ODM) as a format 
      for Core Datasets was evaluated and a web tool was developed which received 
      Source ODM XML files and--via Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation 
      (XSLT)--generated standardized Core Dataset ODM XML files. Using this tool, data 
      from different source systems were extracted and pooled for joined analysis in a 
      proof-of-concept study, facilitating both, basic syntactic and semantic 
      interoperability.

TI  - Modelling digital health data: The ExaMode ontology for computational pathology.
PG  - 100332
LID - 10.1016/j.jpi.2023.100332 [doi]
LID - 100332
AB  - Computational pathology can significantly benefit from ontologies to standardize 
      the employed nomenclature and help with knowledge extraction processes for 
      high-quality annotated image datasets. The end goal is to reach a shared model 
      for digital pathology to overcome data variability and integration problems. 
      Indeed, data annotation in such a specific domain is still an unsolved challenge 
      and datasets cannot be steadily reused in diverse contexts due to heterogeneity 
      issues of the adopted labels, multilingualism, and different clinical practices. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This paper presents the ExaMode ontology, modeling the 
      histopathology process by considering 3 key cancer diseases (colon, cervical, and 
      lung tumors) and celiac disease. The ExaMode ontology has been designed bottom-up 
      in an iterative fashion with continuous feedback and validation from pathologists 
      and clinicians. The ontology is organized into 5 semantic areas that defines an 
      ontological template to model any disease of interest in histopathology. RESULTS: 
      The ExaMode ontology is currently being used as a common semantic layer in: (i) 
      an entity linking tool for the automatic annotation of medical records; (ii) a 
      web-based collaborative annotation tool for histopathology text reports; and 
      (iii) a software platform for building holistic solutions integrating multimodal 
      histopathology data. DISCUSSION: The ontology ExaMode is a key means to store 
      data in a graph database according to the RDF data model. The creation of an RDF 
      dataset can help develop more accurate algorithms for image analysis, especially 
      in the field of digital pathology. This approach allows for seamless data 
      integration and a unified query access point, from which we can extract relevant 
      clinical insights about the considered diseases using SPARQL queries.

PG  - 970-982
LID - 10.1007/s10278-022-00615-w [doi]
AB  - Integrating the information coming from biological samples with digital data, 
      such as medical images, has gained prominence with the advent of precision 
      medicine. Research in this field faces an ever-increasing amount of data to 
      manage and, as a consequence, the need to structure these data in a functional 
      and standardized fashion to promote and facilitate cooperation among 
      institutions. Inspired by the Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing 
      (MIABIS), we propose an extended data model which aims to standardize data 
      collections where both biological and digital samples are involved. In the 
      proposed model, strong emphasis is given to the cause-effect relationships among 
      factors as these are frequently encountered in clinical workflows. To test the 
      data model in a realistic context, we consider the Continuous Observation of 
      SMOking Subjects (COSMOS) dataset as case study, consisting of 10 consecutive 
      years of lung cancer screening and follow-up on more than 5000 subjects. The 
      structure of the COSMOS database, implemented to facilitate the process of data 
      retrieval, is therefore presented along with a description of data that we hope 
      to share in a public repository for lung cancer screening research.

      oncology care.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - Given the drive toward personalized, value-based, and coordinated cancer care 
      delivery, modern knowledge-based practice is being shaped within the context of 
      an increasingly technology-driven healthcare landscape. The ultimate promise of 
      'precision medicine' is predicated on taking advantage of the range of new 
      capabilities for integrating disease- and individual-specific data to define new 
      taxonomies as part of a systems-based knowledge network. Specifically, with 
      cancer being a constantly evolving complex disease process, proper care of an 
      individual will require the ability to seamlessly integrate multi-dimensional 
      'omic' and clinical data. Importantly, however, the challenges of curating 
      knowledge from multiple dynamic data sources and translating to practice at the 
      point-of-care highlight parallel needs. As patients, caregivers, and their 
      environments become more proactive in clinical care and management, practical 
      success of precision medicine is equally dependent on the development of proper 
      infrastructures for evolving data integration, platforms for knowledge 
      representation in a clinically-relevant context, and implementation within a 
      provider's work-life and workflow.

TI  - Osteosarcoma Explorer: A Data Commons With Clinical, Genomic, Protein, and Tissue 
      Imaging Data for Osteosarcoma Research.
PG  - e2300104

AB  - PURPOSE: Osteosarcoma research advancement requires enhanced data integration 
      across different modalities and sources. Current osteosarcoma research, 
      encompassing clinical, genomic, protein, and tissue imaging data, is hindered by 
      the siloed landscape of data generation and storage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Clinical, molecular profiling, and tissue imaging data for 573 patients with 
      pediatric osteosarcoma were collected from four public and institutional sources. 
      A common data model incorporating standardized terminology was created to 
      facilitate the transformation, integration, and load of source data into a 
      relational database. On the basis of this database, a data commons accompanied by 
      a user-friendly web portal was developed, enabling various data exploration and 
      analytics functions. RESULTS: The Osteosarcoma Explorer (OSE) was released to the 
      public in 2021. Leveraging a comprehensive and harmonized data set on the 
      backend, the OSE offers a wide range of functions, including Cohort Discovery, 
      Patient Dashboard, Image Visualization, and Online Analysis. Since its initial 
      release, the OSE has experienced an increasing utilization by the osteosarcoma 
      research community and provided solid, continuous user support. To our knowledge, 
      the OSE is the largest (N = 573) and most comprehensive research data commons for 
      pediatric osteosarcoma, a rare disease. This project demonstrates an effective 
      framework for data integration and data commons development that can be readily 
      applied to other projects sharing similar goals. CONCLUSION: The OSE offers an 
      online exploration and analysis platform for integrated clinical, molecular 
      profiling, and tissue imaging data of osteosarcoma. Its underlying data model, 
      database, and web framework support continuous expansion onto new data modalities 
      and sources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) has a high incidence and prevalence in the 
      worldwide population. The broad terminology associated with these diseases and 
      their multimodality treatments generates large amounts of heterogeneous clinical 
      data, which motivates the construction of a high-quality harmonization model to 
      standardize this multi-source clinical data in terms of format and semantics. The 
      use of ontologies and semantic techniques is a well-known approach to face this 
      challenge. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to provide a clinically reliable data model 
      for HNC processes during all phases of the disease: prognosis, treatment, and 
      follow-up. Therefore, we built the first ontology specifically focused on the HNC 
      domain, named HeNeCOn (Head and Neck Cancer Ontology). METHODS: First, an 
      annotated dataset was established to provide a formal reference description of 
      HNC. Then, 170 clinical variables were organized into a taxonomy, and later 
      expanded and mapped to formalize and integrate multiple databases into the 
      HeNeCOn ontology. The outcomes of this iterative process were reviewed and 
      validated by clinicians and statisticians. RESULTS: HeNeCOn is an ontology 
      consisting of 502 classes, a taxonomy with a hierarchical structure, semantic 
      definitions of 283 medical terms and detailed relations between them, which can 
      be used as a tool for information extraction and knowledge management. 
      CONCLUSION: HeNeCOn is a reusable, extendible and standardized ontology which 
      establishes a reference data model for terminology structure and standard 
      definitions in the Head and Neck Cancer domain. This ontology allows handling 
      both current and newly generated knowledge in Head and Neck cancer research, by 
      means of data linking and mapping with other public ontologies.

TI  - Towards Implementation of OMOP in a German University Hospital Consortium.
PG  - 54-61
LID - 10.1055/s-0037-1617452 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2015, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research 
      initiated a large data integration and data sharing research initiative to 
      improve the reuse of data from patient care and translational research. The 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model and the 
      Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tools could be used as 
      a core element in this initiative for harmonizing the terminologies used as well 
      as facilitating the federation of research analyses across institutions. 
      OBJECTIVE: To realize an OMOP/OHDSI-based pilot implementation within a 
      consortium of eight German university hospitals, evaluate the applicability to 
      support data harmonization and sharing among them, and identify potential 
      enhancement requirements. METHODS: The vocabularies and terminological mapping 
      required for importing the fact data were prepared, and the process for importing 
      the data from the source files was designed. For eight German university 
      hospitals, a virtual machine preconfigured with the OMOP database and the OHDSI 
      tools as well as the jobs to import the data and conduct the analysis was 
      provided. Last, a federated/distributed query to test the approach was executed. 
      RESULTS: While the mapping of ICD-10 German Modification succeeded with a rate of 
      98.8% of all terms for diagnoses, the procedures could not be mapped and hence an 
      extension to the OMOP standard terminologies had to be made.Overall, the data of 
      3 million inpatients with approximately 26 million conditions, 21 million 
      procedures, and 23 million observations have been imported.A federated query to 
      identify a cohort of colorectal cancer patients was successfully executed and 
      yielded 16,701 patient cases visualized in a Sunburst plot. CONCLUSION: 
      OMOP/OHDSI is a viable open source solution for data integration in a German 
      research consortium. Once the terminology problems can be solved, researchers can 
      build on an active community for further development.

TI  - The PRISM semantic cohort builder: a novel tool to search and access clinical 
      data in TCIA imaging collections.

LID - 014003
AB  - The cancer imaging archive (TICA) receives and manages an ever-increasing 
      quantity of clinical (non-image) data containing valuable information about 
      subjects in imaging collections. To harmonize and integrate these data, we have 
      first cataloged the types of information occurring across public TCIA 
      collections. We then produced mappings for these diverse instance data using 
      ontology-based representation patterns and transformed the data into a knowledge 
      graph in a semantic database. This repository combined the transformed instance 
      data with relevant background knowledge from domain ontologies. The resulting 
      repository of semantically integrated data is a rich source of information about 
      subjects that can be queried across imaging collections. Building on this work we 
      have implemented and deployed a REST API and a user-facing semantic cohort 
      builder tool. This tool allows allow researchers and other users to search and 
      identify groups of subject-level records based on non-image data that were not 
      queryable prior to this work. The search results produced by this interface link 
      to images, allowing users to quickly identify and view images matching the 
      selection criteria, as well as allowing users to export the harmonized clinical 
      data.

TI  - Reactome graph database: Efficient access to complex pathway data.
PG  - e1005968
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005968 [doi]
LID - e1005968
AB  - Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed 
      knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide 
      easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, 
      biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational 
      databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues 
      associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a 
      graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale 
      behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService 
      (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its 
      query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data 
      model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this 
      technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 
      93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic 
      access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more 
      complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data 
      storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high 
      performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database 
      use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data 
      types.

TI  - PCAO2: an ontology for integration of prostate cancer associated genotypic, 
      phenotypic and lifestyle data.
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbae136 [doi]
LID - bbae136
AB  - Disease ontologies facilitate the semantic organization and representation of 
      domain-specific knowledge. In the case of prostate cancer (PCa), large volumes of 
      research results and clinical data have been accumulated and needed to be 
      standardized for sharing and translational researches. A formal representation of 
      PCa-associated knowledge will be essential to the diverse data standardization, 
      data sharing and the future knowledge graph extraction, deep phenotyping and 
      explainable artificial intelligence developing. In this study, we constructed an 
      updated PCa ontology (PCAO2) based on the ontology development life cycle. An 
      online information retrieval system was designed to ensure the usability of the 
      ontology. The PCAO2 with a subclass-based taxonomic hierarchy covers the major 
      biomedical concepts for PCa-associated genotypic, phenotypic and lifestyle data. 
      The current version of the PCAO2 contains 633 concepts organized under three 
      biomedical viewpoints, namely, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment. These 
      concepts are enriched by the addition of definition, synonym, relationship and 
      reference. For the precision diagnosis and treatment, the PCa-associated genes 
      and lifestyles are integrated in the viewpoint of epidemiological aspects of PCa. 
      PCAO2 provides a standardized and systematized semantic framework for studying 
      large amounts of heterogeneous PCa data and knowledge, which can be further, 
      edited and enriched by the scientific community. The PCAO2 is freely available at 
      https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PCAO, http://pcaontology.net/ and

TI  - Integrating real-world data from Brazil and Pakistan into the OMOP common data 
      model and standardized health analytics framework to characterize COVID-19 in the 
      Global South.
PG  - 643-655

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work is to demonstrate the use of a standardized 
      health informatics framework to generate reliable and reproducible real-world 
      evidence from Latin America and South Asia towards characterizing coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Global South. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-level 
      COVID-19 records collected in a patient self-reported notification system, 
      hospital in-patient and out-patient records, and community diagnostic labs were 
      harmonized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model 
      and analyzed using a federated network analytics framework. Clinical 
      characteristics of individuals tested for, diagnosed with or tested positive for, 
      hospitalized with, admitted to intensive care unit with, or dying with COVID-19 
      were estimated. RESULTS: Two COVID-19 databases covering 8.3 million people from 
      Pakistan and 2.6 million people from Bahia, Brazil were analyzed. 109 504 
      (Pakistan) and 921 (Brazil) medical concepts were harmonized to Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. In total, 341 505 (4.1%) people 
      in the Pakistan dataset and 1 312 832 (49.2%) people in the Brazilian dataset 
      were tested for COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 20, 2022, with a 
      median [IQR] age of 36 [25, 76] and 38 (27, 50); 40.3% and 56.5% were female in 
      Pakistan and Brazil, respectively. 1.2% percent individuals in the Pakistan 
      dataset had Afghan ethnicity. In Brazil, 52.3% had mixed ethnicity. In agreement 
      with international findings, COVID-19 outcomes were more severe in men, elderly, 
      and those with underlying health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 data from 2 
      large countries in the Global South were harmonized and analyzed using a 
      standardized health informatics framework developed by an international community 
      of health informaticians. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates a potential 
      open science framework for global knowledge mobilization and clinical translation 
      for timely response to healthcare needs in pandemics and beyond.

TI  - Towards a comprehensive and interoperable representation of consent-based data 
      usage permissions in the German medical informatics initiative.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s12911-020-01138-6 [doi]
LID - 103
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the German Medical Informatics Initiative is to establish 
      a national infrastructure for integrating and sharing health data. To this, Data 
      Integration Centers are set up at university medical centers, which address data 
      harmonization, information security and data protection. To capture patient 
      consent, a common informed consent template has been developed. It consists of 
      different modules addressing permissions for using data and biosamples. On the 
      technical level, a common digital representation of information from signed 
      consent templates is needed. As the partners in the initiative are free to adopt 
      different solutions for managing consent information (e.g. IHE BPPC or HL7 FHIR 
      Consent Resources), we had to develop an interoperability layer. METHODS: First, 
      we compiled an overview of data items required to reflect the information from 
      the MII consent template as well as patient preferences and derived permissions. 
      Next, we created entity-relationship diagrams to formally describe the conceptual 
      data model underlying relevant items. We then compared this data model to 
      conceptual models describing representations of consent information using 
      different interoperability standards. We used the result of this comparison to 
      derive an interoperable representation that can be mapped to common standards. 
      RESULTS: The digital representation needs to capture the following information: 
      (1) version of the consent, (2) consent status for each module, and (3) period of 
      validity of the status. We found that there is no generally accepted solution to 
      represent status information in a manner interoperable with all relevant 
      standards. Hence, we developed a pragmatic solution, comprising codes which 
      describe combinations of modules with a basic set of status labels. We propose to 
      maintain these codes in a public registry called ART-DECOR. We present concrete 
      technical implementations of our approach using HL7 FHIR and IHE BPPC which are 
      also compatible with the open-source consent management software gICS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed digital representation is (1) generic enough to capture 
      relevant information from a wide range of consent documents and data use 
      regulations and (2) interoperable with common technical standards. We plan to 
      extend our model to include more fine-grained status codes and rules for 
      automated access control.

TI  - MIRACUM: Medical Informatics in Research and Care in University Medicine.
PG  - e82-e91
LID - 10.3414/ME17-02-0025 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information 
      in Medicine on the German Medical Informatics Initiative. Similar to other large 
      international data sharing networks (e.g. OHDSI, PCORnet, eMerge, RD-Connect) 
      MIRACUM is a consortium of academic and hospital partners as well as one 
      industrial partner in eight German cities which have joined forces to create 
      interoperable data integration centres (DIC) and make data within those DIC 
      available for innovative new IT solutions in patient care and medical research. 
      OBJECTIVES: Sharing data shall be supported by common interoperable tools and 
      services, in order to leverage the power of such data for biomedical discovery 
      and moving towards a learning health system. This paper aims at illustrating the 
      major building blocks and concepts which MIRACUM will apply to achieve this goal. 
      GOVERNANCE AND POLICIES: Besides establishing an efficient governance structure 
      within the MIRACUM consortium (based on the steering board, a central 
      administrative office, the general MIRACUM assembly, six working groups and the 
      international scientific advisory board), defining DIC governance rules and data 
      sharing policies, as well as establishing (at each MIRACUM DIC site, but also for 
      MIRACUM in total) use and access committees are major building blocks for the 
      success of such an endeavor. ARCHITECTURAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY: The MIRACUM 
      DIC architecture builds on a comprehensive ecosystem of reusable open source 
      tools (MIRACOLIX), which are linkable and interoperable amongst each other, but 
      also with the existing software environment of the MIRACUM hospitals. Efficient 
      data protection measures, considering patient consent, data harmonization and a 
      MIRACUM metadata repository as well as a common data model are major pillars of 
      this framework. The methodological approach for shared data usage relies on a 
      federated querying and analysis concept. USE CASES: MIRACUM aims at proving the 
      value of their DIC with three use cases: IT support for patient recruitment into 
      clinical trials, the development and routine care implementation of a 
      clinico-molecular predictive knowledge tool, and molecular-guided therapy 
      recommendations in molecular tumor boards. RESULTS: Based on the MIRACUM DIC 
      release in the nine months conceptual phase first large scale analysis for stroke 
      and colorectal cancer cohorts have been pursued. DISCUSSION: Beyond all 
      technological challenges successfully applying the MIRACUM tools for the 
      enrichment of our knowledge about diagnostic and therapeutic concepts, thus 
      supporting the concept of a Learning Health System will be crucial for the 
      acceptance and sustainability in the medical community and the MIRACUM university 
      hospitals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is strong scientific evidence linking obesity and overweight to 
      the risk of various cancers and to cancer survivorship. Nevertheless, the 
      existing online information about the relationship between obesity and cancer is 
      poorly organized, not evidenced-based, of poor quality, and confusing to health 
      information consumers. A formal knowledge representation such as a Semantic Web 
      knowledge base (KB) can help better organize and deliver quality health 
      information. We previously presented the OC-2-KB (Obesity and Cancer to Knowledge 
      Base), a software pipeline that can automatically build an obesity and cancer KB 
      from scientific literature. In this work, we investigated crowdsourcing 
      strategies to increase the number of ground truth annotations and improve the 
      quality of the KB. METHODS: We developed a new release of the OC-2-KB system 
      addressing key challenges in automatic KB construction. OC-2-KB automatically 
      extracts semantic triples in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions 
      from PubMed abstracts related to the obesity and cancer literature. The accuracy 
      of the facts extracted from scientific literature heavily relies on both the 
      quantity and quality of the available ground truth triples. Thus, we incorporated 
      a crowdsourcing process to improve the quality of the KB. RESULTS: We conducted 
      two rounds of crowdsourcing experiments using a new corpus with 82 obesity and 
      cancer-related PubMed abstracts. We demonstrated that crowdsourcing is indeed a 
      low-cost mechanism to collect labeled data from non-expert laypeople. Even though 
      individual layperson might not offer reliable answers, the collective wisdom of 
      the crowd is comparable to expert opinions. We also retrained the relation 
      detection machine learning models in OC-2-KB using the crowd annotated data and 
      evaluated the content of the curated KB with a set of competency questions. Our 
      evaluation showed improved performance of the underlying relation detection model 
      in comparison to the baseline OC-2-KB. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a new version of 
      OC-2-KB, a system that automatically builds an evidence-based obesity and cancer 
      KB from scientific literature. Our KB construction framework integrated automatic 
      information extraction with crowdsourcing techniques to verify the extracted 
      knowledge. Our ultimate goal is a paradigm shift in how the general public 
      access, read, digest, and use online health information.

      Electronic Health Records.
PG  - 1498-1504
AB  - Cancer stage is rarely captured in structured form in the electronic health 
      record (EHR). We evaluate the performance of a classifier, trained on structured 
      EHR data, in identifying prostate cancer patients with metastatic disease. Using 
      EHR data for a cohort of 5,861 prostate cancer patients mapped to the 
      Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) data model, we 
      constructed feature vectors containing frequency counts of conditions, 
      procedures, medications, observations and laboratory values. Staging information 
      from the California Cancer Registry was used as the ground-truth. For identifying 
      patients with metastatic disease, a random forest model achieved precision and 
      recall of 0.90, 0.40 using data within 12 months of diagnosis. This compared to 
      precision 0.33, recall 0.54 for an ICD code-based query. High-precision 
      classifiers using hundreds of structured data elements significantly outperform 
      ICD queries, and may assist in identifying cohorts for observational research or 
      clinical trial matching.

TI  - Analysis and visualization of disease courses in a semantically-enabled cancer 
      registry.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/s13326-017-0154-9 [doi]
LID - 46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regional and epidemiological cancer registries are important for 
      cancer research and the quality management of cancer treatment. Many 
      technological solutions are available to collect and analyse data for cancer 
      registries nowadays. However, the lack of a well-defined common semantic model is 
      a problem when user-defined analyses and data linking to external resources are 
      required. The objectives of this study are: (1) design of a semantic model for 
      local cancer registries; (2) development of a semantically-enabled cancer 
      registry based on this model; and (3) semantic exploitation of the cancer 
      registry for analysing and visualising disease courses. RESULTS: Our proposal is 
      based on our previous results and experience working with semantic technologies. 
      Data stored in a cancer registry database were transformed into RDF employing a 
      process driven by OWL ontologies. The semantic representation of the data was 
      then processed to extract semantic patient profiles, which were exploited by 
      means of SPARQL queries to identify groups of similar patients and to analyse the 
      disease timelines of patients. Based on the requirements analysis, we have 
      produced a draft of an ontology that models the semantics of a local cancer 
      registry in a pragmatic extensible way. We have implemented a Semantic Web 
      platform that allows transforming and storing data from cancer registries in RDF. 
      This platform also permits users to formulate incremental user-defined queries 
      through a graphical user interface. The query results can be displayed in several 
      customisable ways. The complex disease timelines of individual patients can be 
      clearly represented. Different events, e.g. different therapies and disease 
      courses, are presented according to their temporal and causal relations. 
      CONCLUSION: The presented platform is an example of the parallel development of 
      ontologies and applications that take advantage of semantic web technologies in 
      the medical field. The semantic structure of the representation renders it easy 
      to analyse key figures of the patients and their evolution at different 
      granularity levels.

TI  - Creation of a structured molecular genomics report for Germany as a local 
      adaption of HL7's Genomic Reporting Implementation Guide.
PG  - 1179-1189
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocad061 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop a dataset definition, information model, 
      and FHIR® specification for key data elements contained in a German molecular 
      genomics (MolGen) report to facilitate genomic and phenotype integration in 
      electronic health records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dedicated expert group 
      participating in the German Medical Informatics Initiative reviewed information 
      contained in MolGen reports, determined the key elements, and formulated a 
      dataset definition. HL7's Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (IG) was 
      adopted as a basis for the FHIR® specification which was subjected to a public 
      ballot. In addition, elements in the MolGen dataset were mapped to the fields 
      defined in ISO/TS 20428:2017 standard to evaluate compliance. RESULTS: A core 
      dataset of 76 data elements, clustered into 6 categories was created to represent 
      all key information of German MolGen reports. Based on this, a FHIR specification 
      with 16 profiles, 14 derived from HL7®'s Genomics Reporting IG and 2 additional 
      profiles (of the FamilyMemberHistory and RiskAssessment resources), was 
      developed. Five example resource bundles show how our adaptation of an 
      international standard can be used to model MolGen report data that was requested 
      following oncological or rare disease indications. Furthermore, the map of the 
      MolGen report data elements to the fields defined by the ISO/TC 20428:2017 
      standard, confirmed the presence of the majority of required fields. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our report serves as a template for other research initiatives attempting to 
      create a standard format for unstructured genomic report data. Use of standard 
      formats facilitates integration of genomic data into electronic health records 
      for clinical decision support.

TI  - ADT2FHIR - A Tool for Converting ADT/GEKID Oncology Data to HL7 FHIR Resources.
PG  - 104-110
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210547 [doi]
AB  - Harmonized and interoperable data management is a core requirement for federated 
      infrastructures in clinical research. Institutions participating in such 
      infrastructures often have to invest large degrees of time and resources in 
      implementing necessary data integration processes to convert their local data to 
      the required target structure. If the data is already available in an alternative 
      shared data structure, the transformation from source to the desired target 
      structure can be implemented once and then be distributed to all participants to 
      reduce effort and harmonize results. The HL7® FHIR® standard is used as a basis 
      for the shared data model of several medical consortia like DKTK and GBA. It is 
      based on so-called resources which can be represented in XML. Oncological data in 
      German university hospitals is commonly available in the ADT/GEKID format. From 
      this common basis we conceptualized and implemented a transformation which 
      accepts ADT/GEKID XML files and returns FHIR resources. We identified several 
      problems with using the general ADT/GEKID structure in federated research 
      infrastructures, as well as some possible pitfalls relating to the FHIR need for 
      resource ids and focus on semantic coding which differs from the approach in the 
      ADT/GEKID standard. To facilitate participation in federated infrastructures, we 
      propose the ADT2FHIR transformation tool for partners with oncological data in 
      the ADT/GEKID format.

TI  - Tumor Heterogeneity in Gastrointestinal Cancer Based on Multimodal Data Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/genes15091207 [doi]
LID - 1207
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal cancer cells display both morphology and physiology 
      diversity, thus posing a significant challenge for precise representation by a 
      single data model. We conducted an in-depth study of gastrointestinal cancer 
      heterogeneity by integrating and analyzing data from multiple modalities. 
      METHODS: We used a modified Canny algorithm to identify edges from tumor images, 
      capturing intricate nonlinear interactions between pixels. These edge features 
      were then combined with differentially expressed mRNA, miRNA, and immune cell 
      data. Before data integration, we used the K-medoids algorithm to pre-cluster 
      individual data types. The results of pre-clustering were used to construct the 
      kernel matrix. Finally, we applied spectral clustering to the fusion matrix to 
      identify different tumor subtypes. Furthermore, we identified hub genes linked to 
      these subtypes and their biological roles through the application of Weighted 
      Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment 
      analysis. RESULTS: Our investigation categorized patients into three distinct 
      tumor subtypes and pinpointed hub genes associated with each. Genes MAGI2-AS3, 
      MALAT1, and SPARC were identified as having a differential impact on the 
      metastatic and invasive capabilities of cancer cells. CONCLUSION: By harnessing 
      multimodal features, our study enhances the understanding of gastrointestinal 
      tumor heterogeneity and identifies biomarkers for personalized medicine and 
      targeted treatments.

TI  - The shortest path is not the one you know: application of biological network 
      resources in precision oncology research.
PG  - 191-204
LID - 10.1093/mutage/geu078 [doi]
AB  - Several decades of molecular biology research have delivered a wealth of detailed 
      descriptions of molecular interactions in normal and tumour cells. This knowledge 
      has been functionally organised and assembled into dedicated biological pathway 
      resources that serve as an invaluable tool, not only for structuring the 
      information about molecular interactions but also for making it available for 
      biological, clinical and computational studies. With the advent of 
      high-throughput molecular profiling of tumours, close to complete molecular 
      catalogues of mutations, gene expression and epigenetic modifications are 
      available and require adequate interpretation. Taking into account the 
      information about biological signalling machinery in cells may help to better 
      interpret molecular profiles of tumours. Making sense out of these descriptions 
      requires biological pathway resources for functional interpretation of the data. 
      In this review, we describe the available biological pathway resources, their 
      characteristics in terms of construction mode, focus, aims and paradigms of 
      biological knowledge representation. We present a new resource that is focused on 
      cancer-related signalling, the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Networks. We briefly 
      discuss current approaches for data integration, visualisation and analysis, 
      using biological networks, such as pathway scoring, guilt-by-association and 
      network propagation. Finally, we illustrate with several examples the added value 
      of data interpretation in the context of biological networks and demonstrate that 
      it may help in analysis of high-throughput data like mutation, gene expression or 
      small interfering RNA screening and can guide in patients stratification. 
      Finally, we discuss perspectives for improving precision medicine using 
      biological network resources and tools. Taking into account the information about 
      biological signalling machinery in cells may help to better interpret molecular 
      patterns of tumours and enable to put precision oncology into general clinical 
      practice.

TI  - openEHR Mapper - A Tool to Fuse Clinical and Genomic Data Using the openEHR 
      Standard.
PG  - 86-93
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210055 [doi]
AB  - Precision medicine is an emerging and important field for health care. Molecular 
      tumor boards use a combination of clinical and molecular data, such as somatic 
      tumor mutations to decide on personalized therapies for patients who have run out 
      of standard treatment options. Personalized treatment decisions require clinical 
      data from the hospital information system and mutation data to be accessible in a 
      structured way. Here we introduce an open data platform to meet these 
      requirements. We use the openEHR standard to create an expert-curated data model 
      that is stored in a vendor-neutral format. Clinical and molecular patient data is 
      integrated into cBioPortal, a warehousing solution for cancer genomic studies 
      that is extended for use in clinical routine for molecular tumor boards. For data 
      integration, we developed openEHR Mapper, a tool that allows to (i) process input 
      data, (ii) communicate with the openEHR repository, and (iii) export the data to 
      cBioPortal. We benchmarked the mapper performance using XML and JSON as 
      serialization format and added caching capabilities as well as multi-threading to 
      the openEHR Mapper.

TI  - simona: a comprehensive R package for semantic similarity analysis on 
      bio-ontologies.
PG  - 869
LID - 10.1186/s12864-024-10759-4 [doi]
LID - 869
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bio-ontologies are keys in structuring complex biological information 
      for effective data integration and knowledge representation. Semantic similarity 
      analysis on bio-ontologies quantitatively assesses the degree of similarity 
      between biological concepts based on the semantics encoded in ontologies. It 
      plays an important role in structured and meaningful interpretations and 
      integration of complex data from multiple biological domains. RESULTS: We present 
      simona, a novel R package for semantic similarity analysis on general 
      bio-ontologies. Simona implements infrastructures for ontology analysis by 
      offering efficient data structures, fast ontology traversal methods, and elegant 
      visualizations. Moreover, it provides a robust toolbox supporting over 70 methods 
      for semantic similarity analysis. With simona, we conducted a benchmark against 
      current semantic similarity methods. The results demonstrate methods are 
      clustered based on their mathematical methodologies, thus guiding researchers in 
      the selection of appropriate methods. Additionally, we explored annotation-based 
      versus topology-based methods, revealing that semantic similarities solely based 
      on ontology topology can efficiently reveal semantic similarity structures, 
      facilitating analysis on less-studied organisms and other ontologies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Simona offers a versatile interface and efficient implementation for 
      processing, visualization, and semantic similarity analysis on bio-ontologies. We 
      believe that simona will serve as a robust tool for uncovering relationships and 
      enhancing the interoperability of biological knowledge systems.

TI  - Semantically Structured Web Form and Data Storage: A Generic Ontology-Driven 
      Approach Applied to Breast Cancer.
PG  - 205-209
AB  - Interoperability issues are common in biomedical informatics. Structured data 
      acquisition modalities are of major importance since the data acquired need to be 
      adequately structured and encoded to be automatically processed by dedicated 
      systems. We have developed a web application that generates a semantically 
      structured web form from an ontology. Beyond allowing for structured patient data 
      acquisition, the application allows to save patient data in a triplestore storage 
      solution, and to retrieve them. Thus, the application provides a solution for the 
      user to edit, display, and delete patient data, when necessary. The method has 
      been applied to generate a web form to acquire patient data from the breast 
      cancer knowledge model structured as an OWL ontology of the guideline-based 
      decision support system within the European-funded DESIREE project.

TI  - Design and Implementation of a Community Driven Clinical Trial Information 
      Management System for Precision Oncology Settings.
PG  - 105-114
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240844 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Trial recruitment is a crucial factor for precision oncology, 
      potentially improving patient outcomes and generating new scientific evidence. To 
      identify suitable, biomarker-based trials for patients' clinicians need to screen 
      multiple clinical trial registries which lack support for modern trial designs 
      and offer only limited options to filter for in- and exclusion criteria. Several 
      registries provide trial information but are limited regarding factors like 
      timeliness, quality of information and capability for semantic, terminology 
      enhanced searching for aspects like specific inclusion criteria. METHODS: We 
      specified a Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR) Implementation Guide 
      (IG) to represent clinical trials and their meta data. We embedded it into a 
      community driven approach to maintain clinical trial data, which is fed by openly 
      available data sources and later annotated by platform users. A governance model 
      was developed to manage community contributions and responsibilities. RESULTS: We 
      implemented Community Annotated Trial Search (CATS), an interactive platform for 
      clinical trials for the scientific community with an open and interoperable 
      information model. It provides a base to collaboratively annotate clinical trials 
      and serves as a comprehensive information source for community members. Its 
      terminology driven annotations are coined towards precision oncology, but its 
      principles can be transferred to other contexts. CONCLUSION: It is possible to 
      use the FHIR standard and an open-source information model represented in our IG 
      to build an open, interoperable clinical trial register. Advanced features like 
      user suggestions and audit trails of individual resource fields could be 
      represented by extending the FHIR standard. CATS is the first implementation of 
      an open-for-collaboration clinical trial registry with modern oncological trial 
      designs and machine-to-machine communication in mind and its methodology could be 
      extended to other medical fields besides precision oncology. Due to its 
      well-defined interfaces, it has the potential to provide automated patient 
      recruitment decision support for precision oncology trials in digital 
      applications.

TI  - Insights from Adopting a Data Commons Approach for Large-scale Observational 
      Cohort Studies: The California Teachers Study.
PG  - 777-786
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0842 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large-scale cancer epidemiology cohorts (CEC) have successfully 
      collected, analyzed, and shared patient-reported data for years. CECs 
      increasingly need to make their data more findable, accessible, interoperable, 
      and reusable, or FAIR. How CECs should approach this transformation is unclear. 
      METHODS: The California Teachers Study (CTS) is an observational CEC of 133,477 
      participants followed since 1995-1996. In 2014, we began updating our data 
      storage, management, analysis, and sharing strategy. With the San Diego 
      Supercomputer Center, we deployed a new infrastructure based on a data warehouse 
      to integrate and manage data and a secure and shared workspace with 
      documentation, software, and analytic tools that facilitate collaboration and 
      accelerate analyses. RESULTS: Our new CTS infrastructure includes a data 
      warehouse and data marts, which are focused subsets from the data warehouse 
      designed for efficiency. The secure CTS workspace utilizes a remote desktop 
      service that operates within a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
      Act (HIPAA)- and Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)-compliant 
      platform. Our infrastructure offers broad access to CTS data, includes 
      statistical analysis and data visualization software and tools, flexibly manages 
      other key data activities (e.g., cleaning, updates, and data sharing), and will 
      continue to evolve to advance FAIR principles. CONCLUSIONS: Our scalable 
      infrastructure provides the security, authorization, data model, metadata, and 
      analytic tools needed to manage, share, and analyze CTS data in ways that are 
      consistent with the NCI's Cancer Research Data Commons Framework. IMPACT: The 
      CTS's implementation of new infrastructure in an ongoing CEC demonstrates how 
      population sciences can explore and embrace new cloud-based and analytics 
      infrastructure to accelerate cancer research and translation.See all articles in

TI  - Data Integration through Ontology-Based Data Access to Support Integrative Data 
      Analysis: A Case Study of Cancer Survival.
PG  - 1300-1303
LID - 10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217849 [doi]
AB  - To improve cancer survival rates and prognosis, one of the first steps is to 
      improve our understanding of contributory factors associated with cancer 
      survival. Prior research has suggested that cancer survival is influenced by 
      multiple factors from multiple levels. Most of existing analyses of cancer 
      survival used data from a single source. Nevertheless, there are key challenges 
      in integrating variables from different sources. Data integration is a daunting 
      task because data from different sources can be heterogeneous in syntax, schema, 
      and particularly semantics. Thus, we propose to adopt a semantic data integration 
      approach that generates a universal conceptual representation of "information" 
      including data and their relationships. This paper describes a case study of 
      semantic data integration linking three data sets that cover both individual and 
      contextual level factors for the purpose of assessing the association of the 
      predictors of interest with cancer survival using cox proportional hazard models.

TI  - Successful Integration of EN/ISO 13606-Standardized Extracts From a Patient 
      Mobile App Into an Electronic Health Record: Description of a Methodology.
PG  - e40344
LID - 10.2196/40344 [doi]
LID - e40344
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an increasing need to integrate patient-generated health 
      data (PGHD) into health information systems (HISs). The use of health information 
      standards based on the dual model allows the achievement of semantic 
      interoperability among systems. Although there is evidence in the use of the 
      Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (SMART on FHIR) framework for standardized 
      communication between mobile apps and electronic health records (EHRs), the use 
      of European Norm/International Organization for Standardization (EN/ISO) 13606 
      has not been explored yet, despite some advantages over FHIR in terms of modeling 
      and formalization of clinical knowledge, as well as flexibility in the creation 
      of new concepts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design and implement a methodology 
      based on the dual-model paradigm to communicate clinical information between a 
      patient mobile app (Xemio Research) and an institutional ontology-based clinical 
      repository (OntoCR) without loss of meaning. METHODS: This paper is framed within 
      Artificial intelligence Supporting CAncer Patients across Europe (ASCAPE), a 
      project that aims to use artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) 
      mechanisms to support cancer patients' health status and quality of life (QoL). 
      First, the variables "side effect" and "daily steps" were defined and represented 
      with EN/ISO 13606 archetypes. Next, ontologies that model archetyped concepts and 
      map them to the standard were created and uploaded to OntoCR, where they were 
      ready to receive instantiated patient data. Xemio Research used a conversion 
      module in the ASCAPE Local Edge to transform data entered into the app to create 
      EN/ISO 13606 extracts, which were sent to an Application Programming Interface 
      (API) in OntoCR that maps each element in the normalized XML files to its 
      corresponding location in the ontology. This way, instantiated data of patients 
      are stored in the clinical repository. RESULTS: Between December 22, 2020, and 
      April 4, 2022, 1100 extracts of 47 patients were successfully communicated 
      (234/1100, 21.3%, extracts of side effects and 866/1100, 78.7%, extracts of daily 
      activity). Furthermore, the creation of EN/ISO 13606-standardized archetypes 
      allows the reuse of clinical information regarding daily activity and side 
      effects, while with the creation of ontologies, we extended the knowledge 
      representation of our clinical repository. CONCLUSIONS: Health information 
      interoperability is one of the requirements for continuity of health care. The 
      dual model allows the separation of knowledge and information in HISs. EN/ISO 
      13606 was chosen for this project because of the operational mechanisms it offers 
      for data exchange, as well as its flexibility for modeling knowledge and creating 
      new concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experience reported 
      in the literature of effective communication of EN/ISO 13606 EHR extracts between 
      a patient mobile app and an institutional clinical repository using a scalable 
      standard-agnostic methodology that can be applied to other projects, data 
      sources, and institutions.

TI  - Combining the Generic Entity-Attribute-Value Model and Terminological Models into 
      a Common Ontology to Enable Data Integration and Decision Support.
PG  - 541-545
AB  - The integration of clinical information models and termino-ontological models 
      into a unique ontological framework is highly desirable for it facilitates data 
      integration and management using the same formal mechanisms for both data 
      concepts and information model components. This is particularly true for 
      knowledge-based decision support tools that aim to take advantage of all facets 
      of semantic web technologies in merging ontological reasoning, concept 
      classification, and rule-based inferences. We present an ontology template that 
      combines generic data model components with (parts of) existing 
      termino-ontological resources. The approach is developed for the guideline-based 
      decision support module on breast cancer management within the DESIREE European 
      project. The approach is based on the entity attribute value model and could be 
      extended to other domains.

      and deployment platform based on Docker, OMOP-CDM, and FHIR Web Services.
PG  - e0223010
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0223010 [doi]
LID - e0223010
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To take full advantage of decision support, machine 
      learning, and patient-level prediction models, it is important that models are 
      not only created, but also deployed in a clinical setting. The KETOS platform 
      demonstrated in this work implements a tool for researchers allowing them to 
      perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a secure environment. 
      METHODS: The proposed system uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers 
      with reproducible data analysis and development environments, accessible via 
      Jupyter Notebook, to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy 
      models based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular 
      fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast 
      Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access patient data. In 
      our prototypical implementation we use an OMOP common data model (OMOP-CDM) 
      database. The architecture supports the entire research lifecycle from creating a 
      data analysis environment, retrieving data, and training to final deployment in a 
      hospital setting. RESULTS: We evaluated the platform by establishing and 
      deploying an analysis and end user application for hemoglobin reference intervals 
      within the University Hospital Erlangen. To demonstrate the potential of the 
      system to deploy arbitrary models, we loaded a colorectal cancer dataset into an 
      OMOP database and built machine learning models to predict patient outcomes and 
      made them available via a web service. We demonstrated both the integration with 
      FHIR as well as an example end user application. Finally, we integrated the 
      platform with the open source DataSHIELD architecture to allow for distributed 
      privacy preserving data analysis and training across networks of hospitals. 
      CONCLUSION: The KETOS platform takes a novel approach to data analysis, training 
      and deploying decision support models in a hospital or healthcare setting. It 
      does so in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, combining the flexibility of 
      Docker virtualization with the advantages of standardized vocabularies, a widely 
      applied database schema (OMOP-CDM), and a standardized way to exchange medical 
      data (FHIR).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinicians' ability to use and interpret genetic information depends 
      upon how those data are displayed in electronic health records (EHRs). There is a 
      critical need to develop systems to effectively display genetic information in 
      EHRs and augment clinical decision support (CDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Clinical Sequencing Exploratory 
      Research and Electronic Medical Records & Genomics EHR Working Groups conducted a 
      multiphase, iterative process involving working group discussions and 2 surveys 
      in order to determine how genetic and genomic information are currently displayed 
      in EHRs, envision optimal uses for different types of genetic or genomic 
      information, and prioritize areas for EHR improvement. RESULTS: There is 
      substantial heterogeneity in how genetic information enters and is documented in 
      EHR systems. Most institutions indicated that genetic information was displayed 
      in multiple locations in their EHRs. Among surveyed institutions, genetic 
      information enters the EHR through multiple laboratory sources and through 
      clinician notes. For laboratory-based data, the source laboratory was the main 
      determinant of the location of genetic information in the EHR. The highest 
      priority recommendation was to address the need to implement CDS mechanisms and 
      content for decision support for medically actionable genetic information. 
      CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity of genetic information flow and importance of source 
      laboratory, rather than clinical content, as a determinant of information 
      representation are major barriers to using genetic information optimally in 
      patient care. Greater effort to develop interoperable systems to receive and 
      consistently display genetic and/or genomic information and alert clinicians to 
      genomic-dependent improvements to clinical care is recommended.

TI  - Integrating Clinical Data and Medical Imaging in Lung Cancer: Feasibility Study 
      Using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model Extension.
PG  - e59187
LID - 10.2196/59187 [doi]
LID - e59187
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital transformation, particularly the integration of medical 
      imaging with clinical data, is vital in personalized medicine. The Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) standardizes health 
      data. However, integrating medical imaging remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study proposes a method for combining medical imaging data with the OMOP CDM to 
      improve multimodal research. METHODS: Our approach included the analysis and 
      selection of digital imaging and communications in medicine header tags, 
      validation of data formats, and alignment according to the OMOP CDM framework. 
      The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ImagingStudy profile guided our 
      consistency in column naming and definitions. Imaging Common Data Model (I-CDM), 
      constructed using the entity-attribute-value model, facilitates scalable and 
      efficient medical imaging data management. For patients with lung cancer 
      diagnosed between 2010 and 2017, we introduced 4 new tables-IMAGING_STUDY, 
      IMAGING_SERIES, IMAGING_ANNOTATION, and FILEPATH-to standardize various 
      imaging-related data and link to clinical data. RESULTS: This framework 
      underscores the effectiveness of I-CDM in enhancing our understanding of lung 
      cancer diagnostics and treatment strategies. The implementation of the I-CDM 
      tables enabled the structured organization of a comprehensive data set, including 
      282,098 IMAGING_STUDY, 5,674,425 IMAGING_SERIES, and 48,536 IMAGING_ANNOTATION 
      records, illustrating the extensive scope and depth of the approach. A 
      scenario-based analysis using actual data from patients with lung cancer 
      underscored the feasibility of our approach. A data quality check applying 44 
      specific rules confirmed the high integrity of the constructed data set, with all 
      checks successfully passed, underscoring the reliability of our findings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that I-CDM can improve the integration and 
      analysis of medical imaging and clinical data. By addressing the challenges in 
      data standardization and management, our approach contributes toward enhancing 
      diagnostics and treatment strategies. Future research should expand the 
      application of I-CDM to diverse disease populations and explore its wide-ranging 
      utility for medical conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Learning Health System (LHS) requires integration of research into 
      routine practice. 'eSource' or embedding clinical trial functionalities into 
      routine electronic health record (EHR) systems has long been put forward as a 
      solution to the rising costs of research. We aimed to create and validate an 
      eSource solution that would be readily extensible as part of a LHS. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The EU FP7 TRANSFoRm project's approach is based on dual modelling, 
      using the Clinical Research Information Model (CRIM) and the Clinical Data 
      Integration Model of meaning (CDIM) to bridge the gap between clinical and 
      research data structures, using the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) standard. 
      Validation against GCP requirements was conducted in a clinical site, and a 
      cluster randomised evaluation by site nested into a live clinical trial. RESULTS: 
      Using the form definition element of ODM, we linked precisely modelled data 
      queries to data elements, constrained against CDIM concepts, to enable automated 
      patient identification for specific protocols and pre-population of electronic 
      case report forms (e-CRF). Both control and eSource sites recruited better than 
      expected with no significant difference. Completeness of clinical forms was 
      significantly improved by eSource, but Patient Related Outcome Measures (PROMs) 
      were less well completed on smartphones than paper in this population. 
      DISCUSSION: The TRANSFoRm approach provides an ontologically-based approach to 
      eSource in a low-resource, heterogeneous, highly distributed environment, that 
      allows precise prospective mapping of data elements in the EHR. CONCLUSION: 
      Further studies using this approach to CDISC should optimise the delivery of 
      PROMS, whilst building a sustainable infrastructure for eSource with research 
      networks, trials units and EHR vendors.

TI  - QL(4)MDR: a GraphQL query language for ISO 11179-based metadata repositories.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0794-z [doi]
LID - 45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous healthcare instance data can hardly be integrated 
      without harmonizing its schema-level metadata. Many medical research projects and 
      organizations use metadata repositories to edit, store and reuse data elements. 
      However, existing metadata repositories differ regarding software implementation 
      and have shortcomings when it comes to exchanging metadata. This work aims to 
      define a uniform interface with a technical interlingua between the different MDR 
      implementations in order to enable and facilitate the exchange of metadata, to 
      query over distributed systems and to promote cooperation. To design a unified 
      interface for multiple existing MDRs, a standardized data model must be agreed 
      on. The ISO 11179 is an international standard for the representation of 
      metadata, and since most MDR systems claim to be at least partially compliant, it 
      is suitable for defining an interface thereupon. Therefore, each repository must 
      be able to define which parts can be served and the interface must be able to 
      handle highly linked data. GraphQL is a data access layer and defines query 
      techniques designed to navigate easily through complex data structures. RESULTS: 
      We propose QL(4)MDR, an ISO 11179-3 compatible GraphQL query language. The 
      GraphQL schema for QL(4)MDR is derived from the ISO 11179 standard and defines 
      objects, fields, queries and mutation types. Entry points within the schema 
      define the path through the graph to enable search functionalities, but also the 
      exchange is promoted by mutation types, which allow creating, updating and 
      deleting of metadata. QL(4)MDR is the foundation for the uniform interface, which 
      is implemented in a modern web-based interface prototype. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      introduced a uniform query interface for metadata repositories combining the ISO 
      11179 standard for metadata repositories and the GraphQL query language. A 
      reference implementation based on the existing Samply.MDR was implemented. The 
      interface facilitates access to metadata, enables better interaction with 
      metadata as well as a basis for connecting existing repositories. We invite other 
      ISO 11179-based metadata repositories to take this approach into account.

TI  - Efficient Results in Semantic Interoperability for Health Care. Findings from the 
      Section on Knowledge Representation and Management.
PG  - 184-187
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize excellent current research in the field of Knowledge 
      Representation and Management (KRM) within the health and medical care domain. 
      METHOD: We provide a synopsis of the 2016 IMIA selected articles as well as a 
      related synthetic overview of the current and future field activities. A first 
      step of the selection was performed through MEDLINE querying with a list of MeSH 
      descriptors completed by a list of terms adapted to the KRM section. The second 
      step of the selection was completed by the two section editors who separately 
      evaluated the set of 1,432 articles. The third step of the selection consisted of 
      a collective work that merged the evaluation results to retain 15 articles for 
      peer-review. RESULTS: The selection and evaluation process of this Yearbook's 
      section on Knowledge Representation and Management has yielded four excellent and 
      interesting articles regarding semantic interoperability for health care by 
      gathering heterogeneous sources (knowledge and data) and auditing ontologies. In 
      the first article, the authors present a solution based on standards and Semantic 
      Web technologies to access distributed and heterogeneous datasets in the domain 
      of breast cancer clinical trials. The second article describes a knowledge-based 
      recommendation system that relies on ontologies and Semantic Web rules in the 
      context of chronic diseases dietary. The third article is related to 
      concept-recognition and text-mining to derive common human diseases model and a 
      phenotypic network of common diseases. In the fourth article, the authors 
      highlight the need for auditing the SNOMED CT. They propose to use a crowdbased 
      method for ontology engineering. CONCLUSIONS: The current research activities 
      further illustrate the continuous convergence of Knowledge Representation and 
      Medical Informatics, with a focus this year on dedicated tools and methods to 
      advance clinical care by proposing solutions to cope with the problem of semantic 
      interoperability. Indeed, there is a need for powerful tools able to manage and 
      interpret complex, large-scale and distributed datasets and knowledge bases, but 
      also a need for user-friendly tools developed for the clinicians in their daily 
      practice.

TI  - Creating Synthetic Patients to Address Interoperability Issues: A Case Study with 
      the Management of Breast Cancer Patients.
PG  - 177-181
LID - 10.3233/SHTI200718 [doi]
AB  - Interoperability issues are common in biomedical informatics. Reusing data 
      generated from a system in another system, or integrating an existing clinical 
      decision support system (CDSS) in a new organization is a complex task due to 
      recurrent problems of concept mapping and alignment. The GL-DSS of the DESIREE 
      project is a guideline-based CDSS to support the management of breast cancer 
      patients. The knowledge base is formalized as an ontology and decision rules. 
      OncoDoc is another CDSS applied to breast cancer management. The knowledge base 
      is structured as a decision tree. OncoDoc has been routinely used by the 
      multidisciplinary tumor board physicians of the Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) 
      for three years leading to the resolution of 1,861 exploitable decisions. Because 
      we were lacking patient data to assess the DESIREE GL-DSS, we investigated the 
      option of reusing OncoDoc patient data. Taking into account that we have two 
      CDSSs with two formalisms to represent clinical practice guidelines and two 
      knowledge representation models, we had to face semantic and structural 
      interoperability issues. This paper reports how we created 10,681 synthetic 
      patients to solve these issues and make OncoDoc data re-usable by the GL-DSS of 
      DESIREE.

TI  - Preliminary exploration of survival analysis using the OHDSI common data model: a 
      case study of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s12911-018-0686-7 [doi]
LID - 116
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data heterogeneity is a common phenomenon related to the secondary 
      use of electronic health records (EHR) data from different sources. The 
      Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Common Data Model 
      (CDM) organizes healthcare data into standard data structures using concepts that 
      are explicitly and formally specified through standard vocabularies, thereby 
      facilitating large-scale analysis. The objective of this study is to design, 
      develop, and evaluate generic survival analysis routines built using the OHDSI 
      CDM. METHODS: We used intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patient data to 
      implement CDM-based survival analysis methods. Our methods comprise the following 
      modules: 1) Mapping local terms to standard OHDSI concepts. The analytical 
      expression of variables and values related to demographic characteristics, 
      medical history, smoking status, laboratory results, and tumor feature data. 
      These data were mapped to standard OHDSI concepts through a manual analysis; 2) 
      Loading patient data into the CDM using the concept mappings; 3) Developing an R 
      interface that supports the portable survival analysis on top of OHDSI CDM, and 
      comparing the CDM-based analysis results with those using traditional statistical 
      analysis methods. RESULTS: Our dataset contained 346 patients diagnosed with ICC. 
      The collected clinical data contains 115 variables, of which 75 variables were 
      mapped to the OHDSI concepts. These concepts mainly belong to four domains: 
      condition, observation, measurement, and procedure. The corresponding standard 
      concepts are scattered in six vocabularies: ICD10CM, ICD10PCS, SNOMED, LOINC, 
      NDFRT, and READ. We loaded a total of 25,950 patient data records into the OHDSI 
      CDM database. However, 40 variables failed to map to the OHDSI CDM as they mostly 
      belong to imaging data and pathological data. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates 
      that conducting survival analysis using the OHDSI CDM is feasible and can produce 
      reusable analysis routines. However, challenges to be overcome include 1) 
      semantic loss caused by inaccurate mapping and value normalization; 2) incomplete 
      OHDSI vocabularies describing imaging data, pathological data, and modular data 
      representation.

TI  - Multimodal modeling with low-dose CT and clinical information for diagnostic 
      artificial intelligence on mediastinal tumors: a preliminary study.
LID - 10.1136/bmjresp-2023-002249 [doi]
LID - e002249
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosing mediastinal tumours, including incidental lesions, using 
      low-dose CT (LDCT) performed for lung cancer screening, is challenging. It often 
      requires additional invasive and costly tests for proper characterisation and 
      surgical planning. This indicates the need for a more efficient and 
      patient-centred approach, suggesting a gap in the existing diagnostic methods and 
      the potential for artificial intelligence technologies to address this gap. This 
      study aimed to create a multimodal hybrid transformer model using the Vision 
      Transformer that leverages LDCT features and clinical data to improve surgical 
      decision-making for patients with incidentally detected mediastinal tumours. 
      METHODS: This retrospective study analysed patients with mediastinal tumours 
      between 2010 and 2021. Patients eligible for surgery (n=30) were considered 
      'positive,' whereas those without tumour enlargement (n=32) were considered 
      'negative.' We developed a hybrid model combining a convolutional neural network 
      with a transformer to integrate imaging and clinical data. The dataset was split 
      in a 5:3:2 ratio for training, validation and testing. The model's efficacy was 
      evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis across 25 
      iterations of random assignments and compared against conventional radiomics 
      models and models excluding clinical data. RESULTS: The multimodal hybrid model 
      demonstrated a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90, significantly 
      outperforming the non-clinical data model (AUC=0.86, p=0.04) and radiomics models 
      (random forest AUC=0.81, p=0.008; logistic regression AUC=0.77, p=0.004). 
      CONCLUSION: Integrating clinical and LDCT data using a hybrid transformer model 
      can improve surgical decision-making for mediastinal tumours, showing superiority 
      over models lacking clinical data integration.
