AB  - We are building the world's first Virtual Child-a computer model of normal and 
      cancerous human development at the level of each individual cell. The Virtual 
      Child will "develop cancer" that we will subject to unlimited virtual clinical 
      trials that pinpoint, predict, and prioritize potential new treatments, bringing 
      forward the day when no child dies of cancer, giving each one the opportunity to 
      lead a full and healthy life.

AB  - The heterogeneity inherent in cancer means that even a successful clinical trial 
      merely results in a therapeutic regimen that achieves, on average, a positive 
      result only in a subset of patients. The only way to optimize an intervention for 
      an individual patient is to reframe their treatment as their own, personalized 
      trial. Toward this goal, we formulate a computational framework for performing 
      personalized trials that rely on four mathematical techniques. First, 
      mathematical models that can be calibrated with patient-specific data to make 
      accurate predictions of response. Second, digital twins built on these models 
      capable of simulating the effects of interventions. Third, optimal control theory 
      applied to the digital twins to optimize outcomes. Fourth, data assimilation to 
      continually update and refine predictions in response to therapeutic 
      interventions. In this perspective, we describe each of these techniques, 
      quantify their "state of readiness", and identify use cases for personalized 
      clinical trials.

TI  - TRIPOD+AI statement: updated guidance for reporting clinical prediction models 
      that use regression or machine learning methods.
PG  - e078378
LID - 10.1136/bmj-2023-078378 [doi]
LID - e078378
AB  - The TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for 
      Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) statement was published in 2015 to provide the 
      minimum reporting recommendations for studies developing or evaluating the 
      performance of a prediction model. Methodological advances in the field of 
      prediction have since included the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
      powered by machine learning methods to develop prediction models. An update to 
      the TRIPOD statement is thus needed. TRIPOD+AI provides harmonised guidance for 
      reporting prediction model studies, irrespective of whether regression modelling 
      or machine learning methods have been used. The new checklist supersedes the 
      TRIPOD 2015 checklist, which should no longer be used. This article describes the 
      development of TRIPOD+AI and presents the expanded 27 item checklist with more 
      detailed explanation of each reporting recommendation, and the TRIPOD+AI for 
      Abstracts checklist. TRIPOD+AI aims to promote the complete, accurate, and 
      transparent reporting of studies that develop a prediction model or evaluate its 
      performance. Complete reporting will facilitate study appraisal, model 
      evaluation, and model implementation.

AB  - Radiotherapy aims to achieve a high tumor control probability while minimizing 
      damage to normal tissues. Personalizing radiotherapy treatments for individual 
      patients, therefore, depends on integrating physical treatment planning with 
      predictive models of tumor control and normal tissue complications. Predictive 
      models could be improved using a wide range of rich data sources, including tumor 
      and normal tissue genomics, radiomics, and dosiomics. Deep learning will drive 
      improvements in classifying normal tissue tolerance, predicting intra-treatment 
      tumor changes, tracking accumulated dose distributions, and quantifying the tumor 
      response to radiotherapy based on imaging. Mechanistic patient-specific computer 
      simulations ('digital twins') could also be used to guide adaptive radiotherapy. 
      Overall, we are entering an era where improved modeling methods will allow the 
      use of newly available data sources to better guide radiotherapy treatments.

AB  - Partial liver removal is an important therapy option for liver cancer. In most 
      patients within a few weeks, the liver is able to fully regenerate. In some 
      patients, however, regeneration fails with often severe consequences. To better 
      understand the control mechanisms of liver regeneration, experiments in mice were 
      performed, guiding the creation of a spatiotemporal 3D model of the regenerating 
      liver. The model represents cells and blood vessels within an entire liver lobe, 
      a macroscopic liver subunit. The model could reproduce the experimental data only 
      if a biomechanical growth control (BGC)-mechanism, inhibiting cell cycle entrance 
      at high compression, was taken into account and predicted that BGC may act as a 
      short-range growth inhibitor minimizing the number of proliferating neighbor 
      cells of a proliferating cell, generating a checkerboard-like proliferation 
      pattern. Model-predicted cell proliferation patterns in pigs and mice were found 
      experimentally. The results underpin the importance of biomechanical aspects in 
      liver growth control.

AB  - Understanding the intricate interactions of cancer cells with the tumor 
      microenvironment (TME) is a pre-requisite for the optimization of immunotherapy. 
      Mechanistic models such as quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) provide 
      insights into the TME dynamics and predict the efficacy of immunotherapy in 
      virtual patient populations/digital twins but require vast amounts of multimodal 
      data for parameterization. Large-scale datasets characterizing the TME are 
      available due to recent advances in bioinformatics for multi-omics data. Here, we 
      discuss the perspectives of leveraging omics-derived bioinformatics estimates to 
      inform QSP models and circumvent the challenges of model calibration and 
      validation in immuno-oncology.

AB  - A model-based planning tool, integrated in an imaging system, is envisioned for 
      CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation. This study aims to evaluate the 
      biophysical model performance, by comparing its prediction retrospectively with 
      the actual ablation ground truth from a clinical dataset in liver. The 
      biophysical model uses a simplified formulation of heat deposition on the 
      applicator and a heat sink related to vasculature to solve the bioheat equation. 
      A performance metric is defined to assess how the planned ablation overlaps the 
      actual ground truth. Results demonstrate superiority of this model prediction 
      compared to manufacturer tabulated data and a significant influence of the 
      vasculature cooling effect. Nevertheless, vasculature shortage due to branches 
      occlusion and applicator misalignment due to registration error between scans 
      affects the thermal prediction. With a more accurate vasculature segmentation, 
      occlusion risk can be estimated, whereas branches can be used as liver landmarks 
      to improve the registration accuracy. Overall, this study emphasizes the benefit 
      of a model-based thermal ablation solution in better planning the ablation 
      procedures. Contrast and registration protocols must be adapted to facilitate its 
      integration into the clinical workflow.

TI  - Virtual clinical trials: A tool for predicting patients who may benefit from 
      treatment beyond progression with pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 236-249
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12896 [doi]
AB  - Enrolling patients in immunotherapy clinical trials is becoming increasingly 
      competitive. Virtual clinical trials can help investigators answer key questions 
      despite this. For example, pembrolizumab is the recommended first-line treatment 
      for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no driver alterations and a 
      programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score ≥50%. Salvage therapies 
      for relapsed/refractory patients are limited. Retrospective studies suggest that 
      a subset of patients may benefit from pembrolizumab beyond progression; these 
      results have not been validated in a prospective study. We constructed digital 
      twins of patients and simulated clinical trials to predict the best salvage 
      therapy after progressive disease (PD) on pembrolizumab. Response dynamics were 
      evaluated at the lesion level to represent patients who experience systemic PD 
      while individual lesions continue shrinking. With >25,000 radiographic lesion 
      measurements from >500 patients, we simulated responses to pembrolizumab, 
      chemotherapy, and PD on pembrolizumab followed by either pembrolizumab beyond 
      progression or salvage chemotherapy. Switching all progressors to salvage 
      chemotherapy was suboptimal. Virtual trials predicted progression-free survival 
      (PFS) from pembrolizumab beyond progression to be comparable with salvage 
      chemotherapy in patients whose PD was due to nontarget progression. A 
      PFS-optimized regimen may improve disease control rates ≥15%. Pembrolizumab 
      beyond progression may benefit a subset of patients with PD-L1-high, driver 
      alteration-free NSCLC, but prospective studies are warranted.

TI  - Edge-based relative entropy as a sensitive indicator of critical transitions in 
      biological systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disease progression in biosystems is not always a steady process but 
      is occasionally abrupt. It is important but challenging to signal critical 
      transitions in complex biosystems. METHODS: In this study, based on the 
      theoretical framework of dynamic network biomarkers (DNBs), we propose a 
      model-free method, edge-based relative entropy (ERE), to identify temporal key 
      biomolecular associations/networks that may serve as DNBs and detect 
      early-warning signals of the drastic state transition during disease progression 
      in complex biological systems. Specifically, by combining gene‒gene interaction 
      (edge) information with the relative entropy, the ERE method converts gene 
      expression values into network entropy values, quantifying the dynamic change in 
      a biomolecular network and indicating the qualitative shift in the system state. 
      RESULTS: The proposed method was validated using simulated data and real 
      biological datasets of complex diseases. The applications show that for certain 
      diseases, the ERE method helps to reveal so-called "dark genes" that are 
      non-differentially expressed but with high ERE values and of essential importance 
      in both gene regulation and prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method 
      effectively identified the critical transition states of complex diseases at the 
      network level. Our study not only identified the critical transition states of 
      various cancers but also provided two types of new prognostic biomarkers, 
      positive and negative edge biomarkers, for further practical application. The 
      method in this study therefore has great potential in personalized disease 
      diagnosis.

      mathematical models capable of forecasting checkpoint inhibitor treatment 
      outcomes in lung cancer?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increased application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) 
      targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in lung cancer treatment generates clinical need to reliably 
      predict individual patients' treatment outcomes. METHODS: To bridge the 
      prediction gap, we examine four different mathematical models in the form of 
      ordinary differential equations, including a novel delayed response model. We 
      rigorously evaluate their individual and combined predictive capabilities with 
      regard to the patients' progressive disease (PD) status through equal weighting 
      of model-derived outcome probabilities. RESULTS: Fitting the complete treatment 
      course, the novel delayed response model (R(2)=0.938) outperformed the simplest 
      model (R(2)=0.865). The model combination was able to reliably predict patient PD 
      outcome with an overall accuracy of 77% (sensitivity = 70%, specificity = 81%), 
      solely through calibration with primary tumor longest diameter measurements. It 
      autonomously identified a subset of 51% of patients where predictions with an 
      overall accuracy of 81% (sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 81%) can be achieved. 
      All models significantly outperformed a fully data-driven machine learning-based 
      approach. IMPLICATIONS: These modeling approaches provide a dynamic baseline 
      framework to support clinicians in treatment decisions by identifying different 
      treatment outcome trajectories with already clinically available measurement 
      data. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Conjoint application of the presented 
      approach with other predictive tools and biomarkers, as well as further disease 
      information (e.g. metastatic stage), could further enhance treatment outcome 
      prediction. We believe the simple model formulations allow widespread adoption of 
      the developed models to other cancer types. Similar models can easily be 
      formulated for other treatment modalities.

AB  - Real-world data (RWD) in the medical field, such as electronic health records 
      (EHRs) and medication orders, are receiving increasing attention from researchers 
      and practitioners. While structured data have played a vital role thus far, 
      unstructured data represented by text (e.g., discharge summaries) are not 
      effectively utilized because of the difficulty in extracting medical information. 
      We evaluated the information gained by supplementing structured data with 
      clinical concepts extracted from unstructured text by leveraging natural language 
      processing techniques. Using a machine learning-based pretrained named entity 
      recognition tool, we extracted disease and medication names from real discharge 
      summaries in a Japanese hospital and linked them to medical concepts using 
      medical term dictionaries. By comparing the diseases and medications mentioned in 
      the text with medical codes in tabular diagnosis records, we found that: (1) the 
      text data contained richer information on patient symptoms than tabular diagnosis 
      records, whereas the medication-order table stored more injection data than text. 
      In addition, (2) extractable information regarding specific diseases showed 
      surprisingly small intersections among text, diagnosis records, and medication 
      orders. Text data can thus be a useful supplement for RWD mining, which is 
      further demonstrated by (3) our practical application system for drug safety 
      evaluation, which exhaustively visualizes suspicious adverse drug effects caused 
      by the simultaneous use of anticancer drug pairs. We conclude that proper use of 
      textual information extraction can lead to better outcomes in medical RWD mining.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Common metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
      hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic dysfunction-associated 
      steatotic liver disease (MASLD), have become a global health burden in the last 
      three decades. The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
      (GBD) data enables the first insights into the trends and burdens of these 
      metabolic diseases from 1990 to 2021, highlighting regional, temporal and 
      differences by sex. METHODS: Global estimates of disability-adjusted life years 
      (DALYs) and deaths from GBD 2021 were analyzed for common metabolic diseases 
      (T2DM, hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and MASLD). Age-standardized 
      DALYs (mortality) per 100,000 population and annual percentage change (APC) 
      between 1990 and 2021 were estimated for trend analyses. Estimates are reported 
      with uncertainty intervals (UI). RESULTS: In 2021, among five common metabolic 
      diseases, hypertension had the greatest burden (226 million [95 % UI: 190-259] 
      DALYs), whilst T2DM (75 million [95 % UI: 63-90] DALYs) conferred much greater 
      disability than MASLD (3.67 million [95 % UI: 2.90-4.61]). The highest absolute 
      burden continues to be found in the most populous countries of the world, 
      particularly India, China, and the United States, whilst the highest relative 
      burden was mostly concentrated in Oceania Island states. The burden of these 
      metabolic diseases has continued to increase over the past three decades but has 
      varied in the rate of increase (1.6-fold to 3-fold increase). The burden of T2DM 
      (0.42 % [95 % UI: 0.34-0.51]) and obesity (0.26 % [95 % UI: 0.17-0.34]) has 
      increased at an accelerated rate, while the rate of increase for the burden of 
      hypertension (-0.30 % [95 % UI: -0.34 to -0.25]) and hypercholesterolemia 
      (-0.33 % [95 % UI: -0.37 to -0.30]) is slowing. There is no significant change in 
      MASLD over time (0.05 % [95 % UI: -0.06 to 0.17]). CONCLUSION: In the 21st 
      century, common metabolic diseases are presenting a significant global health 
      challenge. There is a concerning surge in DALYs and mortality associated with 
      these conditions, underscoring the necessity for a coordinated global health 
      initiative to stem the tide of these debilitating diseases and improve population 
      health outcomes worldwide.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing disease with multiple 
      underlying influences and notable heterogeneity among its clinical and 
      response-to-treatment phenotypes. There is no cure for IBD, and none of the 
      currently available therapies have demonstrated clinical efficacies beyond 
      40%-60%. Data collected about its omics, pathogenesis, and treatment strategies 
      have grown exponentially with time making IBD a prime candidate for artificial 
      intelligence (AI) mediated discovery support. AI can be leveraged to further 
      understand or identify IBD features to improve clinical outcomes. Various 
      treatment candidates are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, offering 
      further approaches and opportunities for increasing the efficacies of treatments. 
      However, currently, therapeutic plans are largely determined using clinical 
      features due to the lack of specific biomarkers, and it has become necessary to 
      step into precision medicine to predict therapeutic responses to guarantee 
      optimal treatment efficacy. This is accompanied by the application of AI and the 
      development of multiscale hybrid models combining mechanistic approaches and 
      machine learning. These models ultimately lead to the creation of digital twins 
      of given patients delivering on the promise of precision dosing and tailored 
      treatment. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a prominent cytokine in cell-to-cell 
      communication in the inflammatory responses' regulation. Dysregulated 
      IL-6-induced signaling leads to severe immunological or proliferative 
      pathologies, such as IBD and colon cancer. This mini-review explores multiscale 
      models with the aim of predicting the response to therapy in IBD. Modeling IL-6 
      biology and generating digital twins enhance the credibility of their prediction.

AB  - The digital twin (DT) is a concept widely used in industry to create digital 
      replicas of physical objects or systems. The dynamic, bi-directional link between 
      the physical entity and its digital counterpart enables a real-time update of the 
      digital entity. It can predict perturbations related to the physical object's 
      function. The obvious applications of DTs in healthcare and medicine are 
      extremely attractive prospects that have the potential to revolutionize patient 
      diagnosis and treatment. However, challenges including technical obstacles, 
      biological heterogeneity, and ethical considerations make it difficult to achieve 
      the desired goal. Advances in multi-modal deep learning methods, embodied AI 
      agents, and the metaverse may mitigate some difficulties. Here, we discuss the 
      basic concepts underlying DTs, the requirements for implementing DTs in medicine, 
      and their current and potential healthcare uses. We also provide our perspective 
      on five hallmarks for a healthcare DT system to advance research in this field.

AB  - Medical digital twins, which represent medical assets, play a crucial role in 
      connecting the physical world to the metaverse, enabling patients to access 
      virtual medical services and experience immersive interactions with the real 
      world. One serious disease that can be diagnosed and treated using this 
      technology is cancer. However, the digitalization of such diseases for use in the 
      metaverse is a highly complex process. To address this, this study aims to use 
      machine learning (ML) techniques to create real-time and reliable digital twins 
      of cancer for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The study focuses on four 
      classical ML techniques that are simple and fast for medical specialists without 
      extensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge, and meet the requirements of 
      the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in terms of latency and cost. The case 
      study focuses on breast cancer (BC), the second most prevalent form of cancer 
      worldwide. The study also presents a comprehensive conceptual framework to 
      illustrate the process of creating digital twins of cancer, and demonstrates the 
      feasibility and reliability of these digital twins in monitoring, diagnosing, and 
      predicting medical parameters.

AB  - The use of digital twins (DTs) has proliferated across various fields and 
      industries, with a recent surge in the healthcare sector. The concept of digital 
      twin for health (DT4H) holds great promise to revolutionize the entire healthcare 
      system, including management and delivery, disease treatment and prevention, and 
      health well-being maintenance, ultimately improving human life. The rapid growth 
      of big data and continuous advancement in data science (DS) and artificial 
      intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly expedite DT research and 
      development by providing scientific expertise, essential data, and robust 
      cybertechnology infrastructure. Although various DT initiatives have been 
      underway in the industry, government, and military, DT4H is still in its early 
      stages. This paper presents an overview of the current applications of DTs in 
      healthcare, examines consortium research centers and their limitations, and 
      surveys the current landscape of emerging research and development opportunities 
      in healthcare. We envision the emergence of a collaborative global effort among 
      stakeholders to enhance healthcare and improve the quality of life for millions 
      of individuals worldwide through pioneering research and development in the realm 
      of DT technology.

AB  - We are rapidly approaching a future in which cancer patient digital twins will 
      reach their potential to predict cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in 
      individual patients. This will be realized based on advances in high performance 
      computing, computational modeling, and an expanding repertoire of observational 
      data across multiple scales and modalities. In 2020, the US National Cancer 
      Institute, and the US Department of Energy, through a trans-disciplinary research 
      community at the intersection of advanced computing and cancer research, 
      initiated team science collaborative projects to explore the development and 
      implementation of predictive Cancer Patient Digital Twins. Several diverse pilot 
      projects were launched to provide key insights into important features of this 
      emerging landscape and to determine the requirements for the development and 
      adoption of cancer patient digital twins. Projects included exploring approaches 
      to using a large cohort of digital twins to perform deep phenotyping and plan 
      treatments at the individual level, prototyping self-learning digital twin 
      platforms, using adaptive digital twin approaches to monitor treatment response 
      and resistance, developing methods to integrate and fuse data and observations 
      across multiple scales, and personalizing treatment based on cancer type. 
      Collectively these efforts have yielded increased insights into the opportunities 
      and challenges facing cancer patient digital twin approaches and helped define a 
      path forward. Given the rapidly growing interest in patient digital twins, this 
      manuscript provides a valuable early progress report of several CPDT pilot 
      projects commenced in common, their overall aims, early progress, lessons learned 
      and future directions that will increasingly involve the broader research 
      community.

AB  - Science faces challenges in developing much-needed precision mental health 
      treatments to accurately identify and diagnose mental health problems and the 
      optimal treatment for each individual. Digital twins (DTs) promise to 
      revolutionize the field of mental health, as they are doing in other fields of 
      science, including oncology and cardiology, where they have been successfully 
      deployed. The use of DTs in mental health is yet to be explored. In this 
      Perspective, we lay the conceptual foundations for mental health DTs (MHDT). An 
      MHDT is a virtual representation of an individual's mental states and processes. 
      It is continually updated from data collected over the lifespan of the 
      individual, and guides mental health professionals in diagnosing and treating 
      patients based on mechanistic models and statistical and machine learning tools. 
      The merits of MHDT are demonstrated through the example of the working alliance 
      between the therapist and the patient, which is one of the most consistent 
      mechanisms predicting treatment outcome.

TI  - The world's first digital cell twin in cancer electrophysiology: a digital 
      revolution in cancer research?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of functional in-silico models, in addition to 
      in-vivo tumor models, opens up new and unlimited possibilities in cancer research 
      and drug development. The world's first digital twin of the A549 cell's 
      electrophysiology in the human lung adenocarcinoma, unveiled in 2021, enables the 
      investigation and evaluation of new research hypotheses about modulating the 
      function of ion channels in the cell membrane, which are important for better 
      understanding cancer development and progression, as well as for developing new 
      drugs and predicting treatments. MAIN BODY: The developed A549 in-silico model 
      allows virtual simulations of the cell's rhythmic oscillation of the membrane 
      potential, which can trigger the transition between cell cycle phases. It is able 
      to predict the promotion or interruption of cell cycle progression provoked by 
      targeted activation and inactivation of ion channels, resulting in abnormal 
      hyper- or depolarization of the membrane potential, a potential key signal for 
      the known cancer hallmarks. For example, model simulations of blockade of 
      transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPC6), which are highly expressed 
      during S-G2/M transition, result in a strong hyperpolarization of the cell's 
      membrane potential that can suppress or bypass the depolarization required for 
      the S-G2/M transition, allowing for possible cell cycle arrest and inhibition of 
      mitosis. All simulated research hypotheses could be verified by experimental 
      studies. SHORT CONCLUSION: Functional, non-phenomenological digital twins, 
      ranging from single cells to cell-cell interactions to 3D tissue models, open new 
      avenues for modern cancer research through "dry lab" approaches that optimally 
      complement established in-vivo and in-vitro methods.

TI  - Developing a Cancer Digital Twin: Supervised Metastases Detection From 
      Consecutive Structured Radiology Reports.
PG  - 826402
LID - 10.3389/frai.2022.826402 [doi]
LID - 826402
AB  - The development of digital cancer twins relies on the capture of high-resolution 
      representations of individual cancer patients throughout the course of their 
      treatment. Our research aims to improve the detection of metastatic disease over 
      time from structured radiology reports by exposing prediction models to 
      historical information. We demonstrate that Natural language processing (NLP) can 
      generate better weak labels for semi-supervised classification of computed 
      tomography (CT) reports when it is exposed to consecutive reports through a 
      patient's treatment history. Around 714,454 structured radiology reports from 
      Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center adhering to a standardized departmental 
      structured template were used for model development with a subset of the reports 
      included for validation. To develop the models, a subset of the reports was 
      curated for ground-truth: 7,732 total reports in the lung metastases dataset from 
      867 individual patients; 2,777 reports in the liver metastases dataset from 315 
      patients; and 4,107 reports in the adrenal metastases dataset from 404 patients. 
      We use NLP to extract and encode important features from the structured text 
      reports, which are then used to develop, train, and validate models. Three 
      models-a simple convolutional neural network (CNN), a CNN augmented with an 
      attention layer, and a recurrent neural network (RNN)-were developed to classify 
      the type of metastatic disease and validated against the ground truth labels. The 
      models use features from consecutive structured text radiology reports of a 
      patient to predict the presence of metastatic disease in the reports. A 
      single-report model, previously developed to analyze one report instead of 
      multiple past reports, is included and the results from all four models are 
      compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best model is 
      used to label all 714,454 reports to generate metastases maps. Our results 
      suggest that NLP models can extract cancer progression patterns from multiple 
      consecutive reports and predict the presence of metastatic disease in multiple 
      organs with higher performance when compared with a single-report-based 
      prediction. It demonstrates a promising automated approach to label large numbers 
      of radiology reports without involving human experts in a time- and 
      cost-effective manner and enables tracking of cancer progression over time.

AB  - Cancer exhibits substantial heterogeneity, manifesting as distinct morphological 
      and molecular variations across tumors, which frequently undermines the efficacy 
      of conventional oncological treatments. Developments in multiomics and sequencing 
      technologies have paved the way for unraveling this heterogeneity. Nevertheless, 
      the complexity of the data gathered from these methods cannot be fully 
      interpreted through multimodal data analysis alone. Mathematical modeling plays a 
      crucial role in delineating the underlying mechanisms to explain sources of 
      heterogeneity using patient-specific data. Intra-tumoral diversity necessitates 
      the development of precision oncology therapies utilizing multiphysics, 
      multiscale mathematical models for cancer. This review discusses recent 
      advancements in computational methodologies for precision oncology, highlighting 
      the potential of cancer digital twins to enhance patient-specific decision-making 
      in clinical settings. We review computational efforts in building 
      patient-informed cellular and tissue-level models for cancer and propose a 
      computational framework that utilizes agent-based modeling as an effective 
      conduit to integrate cancer systems models that encode signaling at the cellular 
      scale with digital twin models that predict tissue-level response in a tumor 
      microenvironment customized to patient information. Furthermore, we discuss 
      machine learning approaches to building surrogates for these complex mathematical 
      models. These surrogates can potentially be used to conduct sensitivity analysis, 
      verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification, which is especially 
      important for tumor studies due to their dynamic nature.

      models. There is growing interest in applying digital twins-based approaches to 
      optimize personalized treatment plans and improve health outcomes. The 
      integration of artificial intelligence is critical in this process, as it enables 
      the development of sophisticated disease models that can accurately predict 
      patient response to therapeutic interventions. There is a unique and equally 
      important application of AI to the real-world component of a digital twin when it 
      is applied to medical interventions. The patient can only be treated once, and 
      therefore, we must turn to the experience and outcomes of previously treated 
      patients for validation and optimization of the computational predictions. The 
      physical component of a digital twins instead must utilize a compilation of 
      available data from previously treated cancer patients whose characteristics 
      (genetics, tumor type, lifestyle, etc.) closely parallel those of a newly 
      diagnosed cancer patient for the purpose of predicting outcomes, stratifying 
      treatment options, predicting responses to treatment and/or adverse events. These 
      tasks include the development of robust data collection methods, ensuring data 
      availability, creating precise and dependable models, and establishing ethical 
      guidelines for the use and sharing of data. To successfully implement digital 
      twin technology in clinical care, it is crucial to gather data that accurately 
      reflects the variety of diseases and the diversity of the population.

AB  - Digital twins in biomedical research, i.e. virtual replicas of biological 
      entities such as cells, organs, or entire organisms, hold great potential to 
      advance personalized healthcare. As all biological processes happen in space, 
      there is a growing interest in modeling biological entities within their native 
      context. Leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) and high-volume 
      biomedical data profiled with spatial technologies, researchers can recreate 
      spatially-resolved digital representations of a physical entity with high 
      fidelity. In application to biomedical fields such as computational pathology, 
      oncology, and cardiology, these generative digital twins (GDT) thus enable 
      compelling in silico modeling for simulated interventions, facilitating the 
      exploration of 'what if' causal scenarios for clinical diagnostics and treatments 
      tailored to individual patients. Here, we outline recent advancements in this 
      novel field and discuss the challenges and future research directions.

TI  - Integrating mechanism-based modeling with biomedical imaging to build practical 
      digital twins for clinical oncology.
PG  - 021304

AB  - Digital twins employ mathematical and computational models to virtually represent 
      a physical object (e.g., planes and human organs), predict the behavior of the 
      object, and enable decision-making to optimize the future behavior of the object. 
      While digital twins have been widely used in engineering for decades, their 
      applications to oncology are only just emerging. Due to advances in experimental 
      techniques quantitatively characterizing cancer, as well as advances in the 
      mathematical and computational sciences, the notion of building and applying 
      digital twins to understand tumor dynamics and personalize the care of cancer 
      patients has been increasingly appreciated. In this review, we present the 
      opportunities and challenges of applying digital twins in clinical oncology, with 
      a particular focus on integrating medical imaging with mechanism-based, 
      tissue-scale mathematical modeling. Specifically, we first introduce the general 
      digital twin framework and then illustrate existing applications of image-guided 
      digital twins in healthcare. Next, we detail both the imaging and modeling 
      techniques that provide practical opportunities to build patient-specific digital 
      twins for oncology. We then describe the current challenges and limitations in 
      developing image-guided, mechanism-based digital twins for oncology along with 
      potential solutions. We conclude by outlining five fundamental questions that can 
      serve as a roadmap when designing and building a practical digital twin for 
      oncology and attempt to provide answers for a specific application to brain 
      cancer. We hope that this contribution provides motivation for the imaging 
      science, oncology, and computational communities to develop practical digital 
      twin technologies to improve the care of patients battling cancer.

AB  - Medical digital twins are computational models of human biology relevant to a 
      given medical condition, which are tailored to an individual patient, thereby 
      predicting the course of disease and individualized treatments, an important goal 
      of personalized medicine. The immune system, which has a central role in many 
      diseases, is highly heterogeneous between individuals, and thus poses a major 
      challenge for this technology. In February 2023, an international group of 
      experts convened for two days to discuss these challenges related to immune 
      digital twins. The group consisted of clinicians, immunologists, biologists, and 
      mathematical modelers, representative of the interdisciplinary nature of medical 
      digital twin development. A video recording of the entire event is available. 
      This paper presents a synopsis of the discussions, brief descriptions of ongoing 
      digital twin projects at different stages of progress. It also proposes a 5-year 
      action plan for further developing this technology. The main recommendations are 
      to identify and pursue a small number of promising use cases, to develop 
      stimulation-specific assays of immune function in a clinical setting, and to 
      develop a database of existing computational immune models, as well as advanced 
      modeling technology and infrastructure.

AB  - Laboratory models derived from clinical samples represent a solid platform in 
      preclinical research for drug testing and investigation of disease mechanisms. 
      The integration of these laboratory models with their digital counterparts (i.e., 
      predictive mathematical models) allows to set up digital twins essential to fully 
      exploit their potential to face the enormous molecular complexity of human 
      organisms. In particular, due to the close integration of cell metabolism with 
      all other cellular processes, any perturbation in cellular physiology typically 
      reflect on altered cells metabolic profiling. In this regard, changes in 
      metabolism have been shown, also in our laboratory, to drive a causal role in the 
      emergence of cancer disease. Nevertheless, a unique metabolic program does not 
      describe the altered metabolic profile of all tumour cells due to many causes 
      from genetic variability to intratumour heterogeneous dependency on nutrients 
      consumption and metabolism by multiple co-existing subclones. Currently, 
      fluxomics approaches just match with the necessity of characterizing the overall 
      flux distribution of cells within given samples, by disregarding possible 
      heterogeneous behaviors. For the purpose of stratifying cancer heterogeneous 
      subpopulations, quantification of fluxes at the single-cell level is needed. To 
      this aim, we here present a new computational framework called single-cell Flux 
      Balance Analysis (scFBA) that aims to set up digital metabolic twins in the 
      perspective of being better exploited within a framework that makes also use of 
      laboratory patient cell models. In particular, scFBA aims at integrating 
      single-cell RNA-seq data within computational population models in order to 
      depict a snapshot of the corresponding single-cell metabolic phenotypes at a 
      given moment, together with an unsupervised identification of metabolic 
      subpopulations.

TI  - Systems-based digital twins to help characterize clinical dose-response and 
      propose predictive biomarkers in a Phase I study of bispecific antibody, 
      mosunetuzumab, in NHL.
PG  - 1134-1148
LID - 10.1111/cts.13501 [doi]
AB  - Phase I oncology clinical trials often comprise a limited number of patients 
      representing different disease subtypes who are divided into cohorts receiving 
      treatment(s) at different dosing levels and schedules. Here, we leverage a 
      previously developed quantitative systems pharmacology model of the anti-CD20/CD3 
      T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, mosunetuzumab, to account for different 
      dosing regimens and patient heterogeneity in the phase I study to inform clinical 
      dose/exposure-response relationships and to identify biological determinants of 
      clinical response. We developed a novel workflow to generate digital twins for 
      each patient, which together form a virtual population (VPOP) that represented 
      variability in biological, pharmacological, and tumor-related parameters from the 
      phase I trial. Simulations based on the VPOP predict that an increase in 
      mosunetuzumab exposure increases the proportion of digital twins with at least a 
      50% reduction in tumor size by day 42. Simulations also predict a left-shift of 
      the exposure-response in patients diagnosed with indolent compared to aggressive 
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype; this increased sensitivity in indolent NHL 
      was attributed to the lower inferred values of tumor proliferation rate and 
      baseline T-cell infiltration in the corresponding digital twins. Notably, the 
      inferred digital twin parameters from clinical responders and nonresponders show 
      that the potential biological difference that can influence response include 
      tumor parameters (tumor size, proliferation rate, and baseline T-cell 
      infiltration) and parameters defining the effect of mosunetuzumab on T-cell 
      activation and B-cell killing. Finally, the model simulations suggest intratumor 
      expansion of pre-existing T-cells, rather than an influx of systemically expanded 
      T-cells, underlies the antitumor activity of mosunetuzumab.

TI  - Predictive digital twin for optimizing patient-specific radiotherapy regimens 
      under uncertainty in high-grade gliomas.
PG  - 1222612
LID - 10.3389/frai.2023.1222612 [doi]
LID - 1222612
AB  - We develop a methodology to create data-driven predictive digital twins for 
      optimal risk-aware clinical decision-making. We illustrate the methodology as an 
      enabler for an anticipatory personalized treatment that accounts for 
      uncertainties in the underlying tumor biology in high-grade gliomas, where 
      heterogeneity in the response to standard-of-care (SOC) radiotherapy contributes 
      to sub-optimal patient outcomes. The digital twin is initialized through prior 
      distributions derived from population-level clinical data in the literature for a 
      mechanistic model's parameters. Then the digital twin is personalized using 
      Bayesian model calibration for assimilating patient-specific magnetic resonance 
      imaging data. The calibrated digital twin is used to propose optimal radiotherapy 
      treatment regimens by solving a multi-objective risk-based optimization under 
      uncertainty problem. The solution leads to a suite of patient-specific optimal 
      radiotherapy treatment regimens exhibiting varying levels of trade-off between 
      the two competing clinical objectives: (i) maximizing tumor control 
      (characterized by minimizing the risk of tumor volume growth) and (ii) minimizing 
      the toxicity from radiotherapy. The proposed digital twin framework is 
      illustrated by generating an in silico cohort of 100 patients with high-grade 
      glioma growth and response properties typically observed in the literature. For 
      the same total radiation dose as the SOC, the personalized treatment regimens 
      lead to median increase in tumor time to progression of around six days. 
      Alternatively, for the same level of tumor control as the SOC, the digital twin 
      provides optimal treatment options that lead to a median reduction in radiation 
      dose by 16.7% (10 Gy) compared to SOC total dose of 60 Gy. The range of optimal 
      solutions also provide options with increased doses for patients with aggressive 
      cancer, where SOC does not lead to sufficient tumor control.

LID - 10.1038/s42256-022-00549-6 [doi]
AB  - The metaverse integrates physical and virtual realities, enabling humans and 
      their avatars to interact in an environment supported by technologies such as 
      high-speed internet, virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed and extended 
      reality, blockchain, digital twins and artificial intelligence (AI), all enriched 
      by effectively unlimited data. The metaverse recently emerged as social media and 
      entertainment platforms, but extension to healthcare could have a profound impact 
      on clinical practice and human health. As a group of academic, industrial, 
      clinical and regulatory researchers, we identify unique opportunities for 
      metaverse approaches in the healthcare domain. A metaverse of 'medical technology 
      and AI' (MeTAI) can facilitate the development, prototyping, evaluation, 
      regulation, translation and refinement of AI-based medical practice, especially 
      medical imaging-guided diagnosis and therapy. Here, we present metaverse use 
      cases, including virtual comparative scanning, raw data sharing, augmented 
      regulatory science and metaversed medical intervention. We discuss relevant 
      issues on the ecosystem of the MeTAI metaverse including privacy, security and 
      disparity. We also identify specific action items for coordinated efforts to 
      build the MeTAI metaverse for improved healthcare quality, accessibility, 
      cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.

AB  - Providing increasingly personalized treatments to patients is a major goal of 
      precision medicine, and digital twins are an emerging paradigm to support this 
      goal. A clinical digital twin is a digital representation of a patient and can be 
      used to deliver personalized treatment recommendations. However, the centralized 
      data collection to support and train digital twin models is already brushing up 
      against patient privacy restrictions. We posit that the use of federated 
      learning, an approach to decentralized machine learning model training, can 
      support digital twins’ performance for clinical applications. We emphasize that 
      the combination of the two could alleviate privacy concerns while bolstering 
      machine learning model performance and resulting predictions.

AB  - Healthcare technologies have seen a surge in utilization during the COVID 19 
      pandemic. Remote patient care, virtual follow-up and other forms of futurism will 
      likely see further adaptation both as a preparational strategy for future 
      pandemics and due to the inevitable evolution of artificial intelligence. This 
      manuscript theorizes the healthcare applications of digital twin technology. 
      Digital twin is a triune concept that involves a physical model, a virtual 
      counterpart, and the interplay between the two constructs. This interface between 
      computer science and medicine is a new frontier with broad potential 
      applications. We propose that digital twin technology can exhaustively and 
      methodologically analyze the associations between a physical cancer patient and a 
      corresponding digital counterpart with the goal of isolating predictors of 
      neurological sequalae of disease. This proposition stems from the premise that 
      data science can complement clinical acumen to scientifically inform the 
      diagnostics, treatment planning and prognostication of cancer care. Specifically, 
      digital twin could predict neurological complications through its utilization in 
      precision medicine, modelling cancer care and treatment, predictive analytics and 
      machine learning, and in consolidating various spectra of clinician opinions.

AB  - The treatment landscape for multiple myeloma (MM) has experienced substantial 
      progress over the last decade. Despite the efficacy of new substances, patient 
      responses tend to still be highly unpredictable. With increasing cognitive burden 
      that is introduced through a complex and evolving treatment landscape, 
      data-driven assistance tools are becoming more and more popular. Model-based 
      approaches, such as digital twins (DT), enable simulation of probable responses 
      to a set of input parameters based on retrospective observations. In the context 
      of treatment decision-support, those mechanisms serve the goal to predict 
      therapeutic outcomes to distinguish a favorable option from a potential failure. 
      In the present work, we propose a similarity-based multiple myeloma digital twin 
      (MMDT) that emphasizes explainability and interpretability in treatment outcome 
      evaluation. We've conducted a requirement specification process using scientific 
      literature from the medical and methodological domains to derive an architectural 
      blueprint for the design and implementation of the MMDT. In a subsequent stage, 
      we've implemented a four-layer concept where for each layer, we describe the 
      utilized implementation procedure and interfaces to the surrounding DT 
      environment. We further specify our solutions regarding the adoption of 
      multi-line treatment strategies, the integration of external evidence and 
      knowledge, as well as mechanisms to enable transparency in the data processing 
      logic. Furthermore, we define an initial evaluation scenario in the context of 
      patient characterization and treatment outcome simulation as an exemplary use 
      case for our MMDT. Our derived MMDT instance is defined by 475 unique entities 
      connected through 438 edges to form a MM knowledge graph. Using the MMRF CoMMpass 
      real-world evidence database and a sample MM case, we processed a complete 
      outcome assessment. The output shows a valid selection of potential treatment 
      strategies for the integrated medical case and highlights the potential of the 
      MMDT to be used for such applications. DT models face significant challenges in 
      development, including availability of clinical data to algorithmically derive 
      clinical decision support, as well as trustworthiness of the evaluated treatment 
      options. We propose a collaborative approach that mitigates the regulatory and 
      ethical concerns that are broadly discussed when automated decision-making tools 
      are to be included into clinical routine.

TI  - Personal Digital Twin: A Close Look into the Present and a Step towards the 
      Future of Personalised Healthcare Industry.

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) play a vital role in revolutionising the healthcare industry, 
      leading to more personalised, intelligent, and proactive healthcare. With the 
      evolution of personalised healthcare, there is a significant need to represent a 
      virtual replica for individuals to provide the right type of care in the right 
      way and at the right time. Therefore, in this paper, we surveyed the concept of a 
      personal digital twin (PDT) as an enhanced version of the DT with actionable 
      insight capabilities. In particular, PDT can bring value to patients by enabling 
      more accurate decision making and proper treatment selection and optimisation. 
      Then, we explored the progression of PDT as a revolutionary technology in 
      healthcare research and industry. However, although several research works have 
      been performed for smart healthcare using DT, PDT is still at an early stage. 
      Consequently, we believe that this work can be a step towards smart personalised 
      healthcare industry by guiding the design of industrial personalised healthcare 
      systems. Accordingly, we introduced a reference framework that empowers smart 
      personalised healthcare using PDTs by bringing together existing advanced 
      technologies (i.e., DT, blockchain, and AI). Then, we described some selected use 
      cases, including the mitigation of COVID-19 contagion, COVID-19 survivor 
      follow-up care, personalised COVID-19 medicine, personalised osteoporosis 
      prevention, personalised cancer survivor follow-up care, and personalised 
      nutrition. Finally, we identified further challenges to pave the PDT paradigm 
      toward the smart personalised healthcare industry.

AB  - Evaluating the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with stool-based service 
      screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) beyond a randomized controlled trial is 
      often intractable and understudied. We aim to estimate the proportion of 
      overdiagnosis in population-based service screening programs for CRC with the 
      fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The natural process of overdiagnosis-embedded 
      disease was first built up to learn transition parameters that quantify the 
      pathway of non-progressive and progressive screen-detected cases calibrated with 
      sensitivity, while also taking competing mortality into account. The Markov 
      algorithms were then developed for estimating these transition parameters based 
      on Taiwan FIT service CRC screening data on 5,417,699 residents aged 50-69 years 
      from 2004 to 2014. Following the digital twin design with the parallel universe 
      structure for emulating the randomized controlled trial, the screened twin, 
      mirroring the control group without screening, was virtually recreated by the 
      application of the above-mentioned trained parameters to predict CRC cases 
      containing overdiagnosis. The ratio of the predicted CRCs derived from the 
      screened twin to the observed CRCs of the control group minus 1 was imputed to 
      measure the extent of overdiagnosis. The extent of overdiagnosis for invasive 
      CRCs resulting from FIT screening is 4.16% (95% CI: 2.61-5.78%). The 
      corresponding figure is increased to 9.90% (95% CI: 8.41-11.42%) for including 
      high grade dysplasia (HGD) and further inflated to 15.83% (95% CI: 15.23-16.46%) 
      when the removal adenoma is considered. The modest proportion of overdiagnosis 
      modelled by the digital twin method, dispensing with the randomized controlled 
      trial design, suggests the harm done to population-based FIT service screening is 
      negligible.

AB  - Mechanistic learning refers to the synergistic combination of mechanistic 
      mathematical modeling and data-driven machine or deep learning. This emerging 
      field finds increasing applications in (mathematical) oncology. This review aims 
      to capture the current state of the field and provides a perspective on how 
      mechanistic learning may progress in the oncology domain. We highlight the 
      synergistic potential of mechanistic learning and point out similarities and 
      differences between purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches concerning 
      model complexity, data requirements, outputs generated, and interpretability of 
      the algorithms and their results. Four categories of mechanistic learning 
      (sequential, parallel, extrinsic, intrinsic) of mechanistic learning are 
      presented with specific examples. We discuss a range of techniques including 
      physics-informed neural networks, surrogate model learning, and digital twins. 
      Example applications address complex problems predominantly from the domain of 
      oncology research such as longitudinal tumor response predictions or 
      time-to-event modeling. As the field of mechanistic learning advances, we aim for 
      this review and proposed categorization framework to foster additional 
      collaboration between the data- and knowledge-driven modeling fields. Further 
      collaboration will help address difficult issues in oncology such as limited data 
      availability, requirements of model transparency, and complex input data which 
      are embraced in a mechanistic learning framework.

      loading by using non-linear finite element analyses.

AB  - Mandibular fractures are one of the most frequently observed injuries within 
      craniofacial region mostly due to tumor-related problems and traumatic events, 
      often related to non-linear effects like impact loading. Therefore, a validated 
      digital twin of the mandible is required to develop the best possible 
      patient-specific treatment. However, there is a need to obtain a fully compatible 
      numerical model that can reflect the patients' characteristics, be available and 
      accessible quickly, require an acceptable level of modeling efforts and knowledge 
      to provide accurate, robust and fast results at the same time under highly 
      non-linear effects. In this study, a validated simulation methodology is 
      suggested to develop a digital twin of mandible, capable of predicting the 
      non-linear response of the biomechanical system under impact loading, which then 
      can be utilized to design treatment strategies even for multiple fractures of the 
      mandibular system. Using Computed Tomography data containing cranial (skull) 
      images of a patient, a 3-dimensional mandibular model, which consists cortical 
      and cancellous bones, disks and fossa is obtained with high accuracy that is 
      compatible with anatomical boundaries. A Finite Element Model (FEM) of the 
      biomechanical system is then developed for a three-level validation procedure 
      including (A) modal analysis, (B) dynamic loading and (C) impact loading. For the 
      modal analysis stage: Free-free vibration modes and frequencies of the system are 
      validated against cadaver test results. For the dynamic loading stage: Two 
      different regions of the mandible are loaded, and maximum stress levels of the 
      system are validated against finite element analyses (FEA) results, where the 
      first loading condition (i) transfers a 2000 N force acting on the symphysis 
      region and, the second loading condition (ii) transfers a 2000 N force acting on 
      the left body region. In both cases, equivalent muscle forces dependent on time 
      are applied. For the impact loading stage: Thirteen different human mandibular 
      models with various tooth deficiencies are used under the effects of traumatic 
      impact forces that are generated by using an impact hammer with different initial 
      velocities to transfer the impulse and momentum, where contact forces and 
      fracture patterns are validated against cadaver tests. Five different anatomical 
      regions are selected as the impact site. The results of the analyzes (modal, 
      dynamic and impact) performed to validate the digital twin model are compared 
      with the similar FEA and cadaver test results published in the literature and the 
      results are found to be compatible. It has been evaluated that the digital twin 
      model and numerical models are quite realistic and perform well in terms of 
      predicting the biomechanical behavior of the mandible. The three-level validation 
      methodology that is suggested in this research by utilizing non-linear FEA has 
      provided a reliable road map to develop a digital twin of a biomechanical system 
      with enough confidence that it can be utilized for similar structures to offer 
      patient-specific treatments and can help develop custom or tailor-made implants 
      or prosthesis for best compliance with the patient even considering the most 
      catastrophic effects of impact related trauma.

AB  - Nanocarriers (NCs) that can precisely deliver active agents, nutrients and 
      genetic materials into plants will make crop agriculture more resilient to 
      climate change and sustainable. As a research field, nano-agriculture is still 
      developing, with significant scientific and societal barriers to overcome. In 
      this Review, we argue that lessons can be learned from mammalian nanomedicine. In 
      particular, it may be possible to enhance efficiency and efficacy by improving 
      our understanding of how NC properties affect their interactions with plant 
      surfaces and biomolecules, and their ability to carry and deliver cargo to 
      specific locations. New tools are required to rapidly assess NC-plant 
      interactions and to explore and verify the range of viable targeting approaches 
      in plants. Elucidating these interactions can lead to the creation of 
      computer-generated in silico models (digital twins) to predict the impact of 
      different NC and plant properties, biological responses, and environmental 
      conditions on the efficiency and efficacy of nanotechnology approaches. Finally, 
      we highlight the need for nano-agriculture researchers and social scientists to 
      converge in order to develop sustainable, safe and socially acceptable NCs.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Deep learning enables label-free all-optical biopsies and automated 
      tissue classification. Endoscopic systems provide intraoperative diagnostics to 
      deep tissue and speed up treatment without harmful tissue removal. However, 
      conventional multi-core fiber (MCF) endoscopes suffer from low resolution and 
      artifacts, which hinder tumor diagnostics. AIM: We introduce a method to enable 
      unpixelated, high-resolution tumor imaging through a given MCF with a diameter of 
      around 0.65 mm and arbitrary core arrangement and inhomogeneous transmissivity. 
      APPROACH: Image reconstruction is based on deep learning and the digital twin 
      concept of the single-reference-based simulation with inhomogeneous optical 
      properties of MCF and transfer learning on a small experimental dataset of 
      biological tissue. The reference provided physical information about the MCF 
      during the training processes. RESULTS: For the simulated data, hallucination 
      caused by the MCF inhomogeneity was eliminated, and the averaged peak 
      signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity were increased from 11.2 dB and 
      0.20 to 23.4 dB and 0.74, respectively. By transfer learning, the metrics of 
      independent test images experimentally acquired on glioblastoma tissue ex vivo 
      can reach up to 31.6 dB and 0.97 with 14 fps computing speed. CONCLUSIONS: With 
      the proposed approach, a single reference image was required in the pre-training 
      stage and laborious acquisition of training data was bypassed. Validation on 
      glioblastoma cryosections with transfer learning on only 50 image pairs showed 
      the capability for high-resolution deep tissue retrieval and high clinical 
      feasibility.

AB  - Digital twins enable simulation, comprehensive analysis and predictions, as 
      virtual representations of physical systems. They are also finding increasing 
      interest and application in the healthcare sector, with a particular focus on 
      digital twins of the brain. We discuss how digital twins in neuroscience enable 
      the modeling of brain functions and pathology as they offer an in-silico approach 
      to studying the brain and illustrating the complex relationships between brain 
      network dynamics and related functions. To showcase the capabilities of digital 
      twinning in neuroscience we demonstrate how the impact of brain tumors on the 
      brain's physical structures and functioning can be modeled in relation to the 
      philosophical concept of plasticity. Against this technically derived backdrop, 
      which assumes that the brain's nonlinear behavior toward improvement and repair 
      can be modeled and predicted based on MRI data, we further explore the 
      philosophical insights of Catherine Malabou. Malabou emphasizes the brain's dual 
      capacity for adaptive and destructive plasticity. We will discuss in how far 
      Malabou's ideas provide a more holistic theoretical framework for understanding 
      how digital twins can model the brain's response to injury and pathology, 
      embracing Malabou's concept of both adaptive and destructive plasticity which 
      provides a framework to address such yet incomputable aspects of neuroscience and 
      the sometimes seemingly unfavorable dynamics of neuroplasticity helping to bridge 
      the gap between theoretical research and clinical practice.

AB  - Renal failure, a public health concern, and the scarcity of nephrologists around 
      the globe have necessitated the development of an AI-based system to 
      auto-diagnose kidney diseases. This research deals with the three major renal 
      diseases categories: kidney stones, cysts, and tumors, and gathered and annotated 
      a total of 12,446 CT whole abdomen and urogram images in order to construct an 
      AI-based kidney diseases diagnostic system and contribute to the AI community's 
      research scope e.g., modeling digital-twin of renal functions. The collected 
      images were exposed to exploratory data analysis, which revealed that the images 
      from all of the classes had the same type of mean color distribution. 
      Furthermore, six machine learning models were built, three of which are based on 
      the state-of-the-art variants of the Vision transformers EANet, CCT, and Swin 
      transformers, while the other three are based on well-known deep learning models 
      Resnet, VGG16, and Inception v3, which were adjusted in the last layers. While 
      the VGG16 and CCT models performed admirably, the swin transformer outperformed 
      all of them in terms of accuracy, with an accuracy of 99.30 percent. The F1 score 
      and precision and recall comparison reveal that the Swin transformer outperforms 
      all other models and that it is the quickest to train. The study also revealed 
      the blackbox of the VGG16, Resnet50, and Inception models, demonstrating that 
      VGG16 is superior than Resnet50 and Inceptionv3 in terms of monitoring the 
      necessary anatomy abnormalities. We believe that the superior accuracy of our 
      Swin transformer-based model and the VGG16-based model can both be useful in 
      diagnosing kidney tumors, cysts, and stones.

TI  - Optimal Treatment Selection in Sequential Systemic and Locoregional Therapy of 
      Oropharyngeal Squamous Carcinomas: Deep Q-Learning With a Patient-Physician 
      Digital Twin Dyad.
PG  - e29455
LID - 10.2196/29455 [doi]
LID - e29455
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, selection of patients for sequential versus concurrent 
      chemotherapy and radiation regimens lacks evidentiary support and it is based on 
      locally optimal decisions for each step. OBJECTIVE: We aim to optimize the 
      multistep treatment of patients with head and neck cancer and predict multiple 
      patient survival and toxicity outcomes, and we develop, apply, and evaluate a 
      first application of deep Q-learning (DQL) and simulation to this problem. 
      METHODS: The treatment decision DQL digital twin and the patient's digital twin 
      were created, trained, and evaluated on a data set of 536 patients with 
      oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with the goal of, respectively, determining 
      the optimal treatment decisions with respect to survival and toxicity metrics and 
      predicting the outcomes of the optimal treatment on the patient. Of the data set 
      of 536 patients, the models were trained on a subset of 402 (75%) patients (split 
      randomly) and evaluated on a separate set of 134 (25%) patients. Training and 
      evaluation of the digital twin dyad was completed in August 2020. The data set 
      includes 3-step sequential treatment decisions and complete relevant history of 
      the patient cohort treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2005 and 2013, 
      with radiomics analysis performed for the segmented primary tumor volumes. 
      RESULTS: On the test set, we found mean 87.35% (SD 11.15%) and median 90.85% (IQR 
      13.56%) accuracies in treatment outcome prediction, matching the clinicians' 
      outcomes and improving the (predicted) survival rate by +3.73% (95% CI -0.75% to 
      8.96%) and the dysphagia rate by +0.75% (95% CI -4.48% to 6.72%) when following 
      DQL treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Given the prediction accuracy and predicted 
      improvement regarding the medically relevant outcomes yielded by this approach, 
      this digital twin dyad of the patient-physician dynamic treatment problem has the 
      potential of aiding physicians in determining the optimal course of treatment and 
      in assessing its outcomes.

AB  - The purpose is to explore the feature recognition, diagnosis, and forecasting 
      performances of Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S3VMs) for brain image 
      fusion Digital Twins (DTs). Both unlabeled and labeled data are used regarding 
      many unlabeled data in brain images, and semi supervised support vector machine 
      (SVM) is proposed. Meantime, the AlexNet model is improved, and the brain images 
      in real space are mapped to virtual space by using digital twins. Moreover, a 
      diagnosis and prediction model of brain image fusion digital twins based on semi 
      supervised SVM and improved AlexNet is constructed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
      (MRI) data from the Brain Tumor Department of a Hospital are collected to test 
      the performance of the constructed model through simulation experiments. Some 
      state-of-art models are included for performance comparison: Long Short-Term 
      Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network 
      (RNN), AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Results demonstrate that the 
      proposed model can provide a feature recognition and extraction accuracy of 
      92.52%, at least an improvement of 2.76% compared to other models. Its training 
      lasts for about 100 s, and the test takes about 0.68 s. The Root Mean Square 
      Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the proposed model are 4.91 and 
      5.59%, respectively. Regarding the assessment indicators of brain image 
      segmentation and fusion, the proposed model can provide a 79.55% Jaccard 
      coefficient, a 90.43% Positive Predictive Value (PPV), a 73.09% Sensitivity, and 
      a 75.58% Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), remarkably better than other models. 
      Acceleration efficiency analysis suggests that the improved AlexNet model is 
      suitable for processing massive brain image data with a higher speedup indicator. 
      To sum up, the constructed model can provide high accuracy, good acceleration 
      efficiency, and excellent segmentation and recognition performances while 
      ensuring low errors, which can provide an experimental basis for brain image 
      feature recognition and digital diagnosis.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is persistently refractory to therapy, and 
      methods to improve targeting and evaluation of responses to therapy in this 
      disease are needed. Here, we integrate quantitative MRI data with biologically 
      based mathematical modeling to accurately predict the response of TNBC to 
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) on an individual basis. Specifically, 56 
      patients with TNBC enrolled in the ARTEMIS trial (NCT02276443) underwent 
      standard-of-care doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (A/C) and then paclitaxel for NAST, 
      where dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI were acquired 
      before treatment and after two and four cycles of A/C. A biologically based model 
      was established to characterize tumor cell movement, proliferation, and 
      treatment-induced cell death. Two evaluation frameworks were investigated using: 
      (i) images acquired before and after two cycles of A/C for calibration and 
      predicting tumor status after A/C, and (ii) images acquired before, after two 
      cycles, and after four cycles of A/C for calibration and predicting response 
      following NAST. For Framework 1, the concordance correlation coefficients between 
      the predicted and measured patient-specific, post-A/C changes in tumor 
      cellularity and volume were 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. For Framework 2, the 
      biologically based model achieved an area under the receiver operator 
      characteristic curve of 0.89 (sensitivity/specificity = 0.72/0.95) for 
      differentiating pathological complete response (pCR) from non-pCR, which is 
      statistically superior (P &amp;lt; 0.05) to the value of 0.78 
      (sensitivity/specificity = 0.72/0.79) achieved by tumor volume measured after 
      four cycles of A/C. Overall, this model successfully captured patient-specific, 
      spatiotemporal dynamics of TNBC response to NAST, providing highly accurate 
      predictions of NAST response. SIGNIFICANCE: Integrating MRI data with 
      biologically based mathematical modeling successfully predicts breast cancer 
      response to chemotherapy, suggesting digital twins could facilitate a paradigm 
      shift from simply assessing response to predicting and optimizing therapeutic 
      efficacy.

AB  - Anti-angiogenic (AA) treatments have received significant research interest due 
      to the key role of angiogenesis in cancer progression. AA agents can have a 
      strong effect on cancer regression, by blocking new vessels and reducing the 
      density of the existing vasculature. Moreover, in a process termed vascular 
      normalisation, AA drugs can improve the abnormal structure and function of the 
      tumour vasculature, enhancing the delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumour 
      site. Despite their promising potential, an improved understanding of AA 
      treatments is necessary to optimise their administration as a monotherapy or in 
      combination with other cancer treatments. In this work we present an in silico 
      multiscale cancer model which is used to systematically interrogate the role of 
      individual mechanisms of action of AA drugs in tumour regression. Focus is placed 
      on the reduction of vascular density and on vascular normalisation through a 
      parametric study, which are considered either as monotherapies or in combination 
      with conventional/ metronomic chemotherapy. The model is specified to data from a 
      mammary carcinoma xenograft in immunodeficient mice, to enhance the physiological 
      relevance of model predictions. Our results suggest that conventional 
      chemotherapy might be more beneficial when combined with AA treatments, hindering 
      tumour growth without causing excessive damage on healthy tissue. Notably, 
      metronomic chemotherapy has shown significant potential in stopping tumour growth 
      with minimal toxicity, even as a monotherapy. Our findings underpin the potential 
      of our in silico framework for non-invasive and cost-effective evaluation of 
      treatment strategies, which can enhance our understanding of combined therapeutic 
      strategies and contribute towards improving cancer treatment management.

AB  - Digital twins represent a promising technology within the domain of precision 
      healthcare, offering significant prospects for individualized medical 
      interventions. Existing systematic reviews, however, mainly focus on the 
      technological dimensions of digital twins, with a limited exploration of their 
      impact on health-related outcomes. Therefore, this systematic review aims to 
      explore the efficacy of digital twins in improving precision healthcare at the 
      population level. The literature search for this study encompassed PubMed, 
      Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, SinoMed, CNKI, and Wanfang 
      Database to retrieve potentially relevant records. Patient health-related 
      outcomes were synthesized employing quantitative content analysis, whereas the 
      Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scales were used to evaluate the quality and 
      potential bias inherent in each selected study. Following established inclusion 
      and exclusion criteria, 12 studies were screened from an initial 1321 records for 
      further analysis. These studies included patients with various conditions, 
      including cancers, type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, heart failure, qi 
      deficiency, post-hepatectomy liver failure, and dental issues. The review coded 
      three types of interventions: personalized health management, precision 
      individual therapy effects, and predicting individual risk, leading to a total of 
      45 outcomes being measured. The collective effectiveness of these outcomes at the 
      population level was calculated at 80% (36 out of 45). No studies exhibited 
      unacceptable differences in quality. Overall, employing digital twins in 
      precision health demonstrates practical advantages, warranting its expanded use 
      to facilitate the transition from the development phase to broad 
      application.PROSPERO registry: CRD42024507256.

TI  - Simulation of Image-Guided Microwave Ablation Therapy Using a Digital Twin 
      Computational Model.
PG  - 107-124

AB  - Emerging computational tools such as healthcare digital twin modeling are 
      enabling the creation of patient-specific surgical planning, including microwave 
      ablation to treat primary and secondary liver cancers. Healthcare digital twins 
      (DTs) are anatomically one-to-one biophysical models constructed from structural, 
      functional, and biomarker-based imaging data to simulate patient-specific 
      therapies and guide clinical decision-making. In microwave ablation (MWA), 
      tissue-specific factors including tissue perfusion, hepatic steatosis, and 
      fibrosis affect therapeutic extent, but current thermal dosing guidelines do not 
      account for these parameters. This study establishes an MR imaging framework to 
      construct three-dimensional biophysical digital twins to predict ablation 
      delivery in livers with 5 levels of fat content in the presence of a tumor. Four 
      microwave antenna placement strategies were considered, and simulated microwave 
      ablations were then performed using 915 MHz and 2450 MHz antennae in Tumor Naïve 
      DTs (control), and Tumor Informed DTs at five grades of steatosis. Across the 
      range of fatty liver steatosis grades, fat content was found to significantly 
      increase ablation volumes by approximately 29-l42% in the Tumor Naïve and 55-60% 
      in the Tumor Informed DTs in 915 MHz and 2450 MHz antenna simulations. The 
      presence of tumor did not significantly affect ablation volumes within the same 
      steatosis grade in 915 MHz simulations, but did significantly increase ablation 
      volumes within mild-, moderate-, and high-fat steatosis grades in 2450 MHz 
      simulations. An analysis of signed distance to agreement for placement strategies 
      suggests that accounting for patient-specific tumor tissue properties 
      significantly impacts ablation forecasting for the preoperative evaluation of 
      ablation zone coverage.

AB  - Despite recent progress in adoptive T cell therapy for cancer, understanding and 
      predicting the kinetics of infused T cells remains a challenge. Multiple factors 
      can impact the distribution, expansion, and decay or persistence of infused T 
      cells in patients. We have developed a novel quantitative systems pharmacology 
      (QSP) model of TCR-transgenic T cell therapy in patients with solid tumors to 
      describe the kinetics of endogenous T cells and multiple memory subsets of 
      engineered T cells after infusion. These T cells undergo lymphodepletion, 
      proliferation, trafficking, differentiation, and apoptosis in blood, lymph nodes, 
      tumor site, and other peripheral tissues. Using the model, we generated 
      patient-matched digital twins that recapitulate the circulating T cell kinetics 
      reported from a clinical trial of TCR-engineered T cells targeting E7 in patients 
      with metastatic HPV-associated epithelial cancers. Analyses of key parameters 
      influencing cell kinetics and differences among digital twins identify stem 
      cell-like memory T cells (T(scm)) cells as an important determinant of both 
      expansion and persistence and suggest that T(scm)-related differences contribute 
      significantly to the observed variability in cellular kinetics among patients. We 
      simulated in silico clinical trials using digital twins and predict that T(scm) 
      enrichment in the infused product improves persistence of the engineered T cells 
      and could enable administration of a lower dose. Finally, we verified the broader 
      relevance of the QSP model, the digital twins, and findings on the importance of 
      T(scm) enrichment by predicting kinetics for two patients with pancreatic cancer 
      treated with KRAS G12D targeting T cell therapy. This work offers insight into 
      the key role of T(scm) biology on T cell kinetics and provides a quantitative 
      framework to evaluate cellular kinetics for future efforts in the development and 
      clinical application of TCR-engineered T cell therapies.

      Plug-In Component Models of a Cancer Digital Twin.

AB  - The massive amount of human biological, imaging, and clinical data produced by 
      multiple and diverse sources necessitates integrative modeling approaches able to 
      summarize all this information into answers to specific clinical questions. In 
      this paper, we present a hypermodeling scheme able to combine models of diverse 
      cancer aspects regardless of their underlying method or scale. Describing 
      tissue-scale cancer cell proliferation, biomechanical tumor growth, nutrient 
      transport, genomic-scale aberrant cancer cell metabolism, and cell-signaling 
      pathways that regulate the cellular response to therapy, the hypermodel 
      integrates mutation, miRNA expression, imaging, and clinical data. The 
      constituting hypomodels, as well as their orchestration and links, are described. 
      Two specific cancer types, Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) and non-small cell lung 
      cancer, are addressed as proof-of-concept study cases. Personalized simulations 
      of the actual anatomy of a patient have been conducted. The hypermodel has also 
      been applied to predict tumor control after radiotherapy and the relationship 
      between tumor proliferative activity and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
      Our innovative hypermodel holds promise as a digital twin-based clinical decision 
      support system and as the core of future in silico trial platforms, although 
      additional retrospective adaptation and validation are necessary.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with advanced cancer frequently suffer from chronic, 
      severe disabling pain. Opioids such as morphine and fentanyl are commonly used to 
      manage this pain. Transdermal drug delivery systems are important technologies 
      for administering drugs in a non-invasive, continuous and controlled manner. Due 
      to the narrow therapeutic range of fentanyl, individualised dosing is essential 
      to avoid underdosing or overdosing. Standard clinical calculation tools for 
      opioid rotation however do not include important patient characteristics that 
      account for interindividual variability of opioid pharmacology. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: We developed a clinical protocol to optimise individual fentanyl dosing 
      in patients with advanced cancer switching from oral or intravenous opioids to 
      transdermal fentanyl by using a physics-based digital twin (DT) that is fed by 
      important clinical and physiological parameters. Individual tailoring of 
      transdermal fentanyl therapy is an approach with the potential for personalised 
      and effective care with an improved benefit-risk ratio. However, clinical 
      validation of physics-based digital twins (PBDT) dosing is crucial to proving 
      clinical benefit.Therapeutic drug monitoring will allow to validate the accuracy 
      of PBDT predictions. Additional monitoring for breathing dynamics, sequential 
      pain levels and fentanyl-related adverse events will contribute to evaluating the 
      performance of PBDT-based dosing of transdermal fentanyl. The primary objective 
      of the study is to develop an experimental protocol to validate DT-guided 
      fentanyl dosing in patients with advanced cancer. This clinical study will bring 
      individualised opioid dosing closer to clinical practice. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Study documents have been approved by the responsible Ethics 
      Committee and study initiation is planned for late summer 2024. Data will be 
      shared with the scientific community no more than 1 year following completion of 
      the study and data assembly.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The shift toward remote patient monitoring methods to detect 
      clinical deterioration requires testing of wearable devices in real-life clinical 
      settings. This study aimed to develop a remote early warning scoring (REWS) 
      system based on continuous measurements using a wearable device, and compare its 
      diagnostic performance for the detection of deterioration to the diagnostic 
      performance of the conventional modified early warning score (MEWS). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: The study population of this prospective, single center trial 
      consisted of patients who underwent major abdominal cancer surgery and were 
      monitored using routine in-hospital spotcheck measurements of the vital 
      parameters. Heart and respiratory rates were measured continuously using a 
      wireless accelerometer patch (HealthDot). The prediction by MEWS of deterioration 
      toward a complication graded Clavien-Dindo of 2 or higher was compared to the 
      REWS derived from continuous measurements by the wearable patch. MAIN RESULTS: A 
      total of 103 patients and 1909 spot-check measurements were included in the 
      analysis. Postoperative deterioration was observed in 29 patients. For both EWS 
      systems, the sensitivity (MEWS: 0.20 95% CI: [0.13-0.29], REWS: 0.20 95% CI: 
      [0.13-0.29]) and specificity (MEWS: 0.96 95% CI: [0.95-0.97], REWS: 0.96 95% CI: 
      [0.95-0.97]) were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of the REWS method, 
      based on continuous measurements of the heart and respiratory rates, is 
      comparable to that of the MEWS in patients following major abdominal cancer 
      surgery. The wearable patch could detect the same amount of deteriorations, 
      without requiring manual spot check measurements.

TI  - Toward an artificial intelligence-assisted framework for reconstructing the

AB  - This article presents an effort toward building an artificial intelligence (AI) 
      assisted framework, coined ReconGAN, for creating a realistic digital twin of the 
      human vertebra and predicting the risk of vertebral fracture (VF). ReconGAN 
      consists of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), 
      image-processing steps, and finite element (FE) based shape optimization to 
      reconstruct the vertebra model. This DCGAN model is trained using a set of 
      quantitative micro-computed tomography (micro-QCT) images of the trabecular bone 
      obtained from cadaveric samples. The quality of synthetic trabecular models 
      generated using DCGAN are verified by comparing a set of its statistical 
      microstructural descriptors with those of the imaging data. The synthesized 
      trabecular microstructure is then infused into the vertebra cortical shell 
      extracted from the patient's diagnostic CT scans using an FE-based shape 
      optimization approach to achieve a smooth transition between trabecular to 
      cortical regions. The final geometrical model of the vertebra is converted into a 
      high-fidelity FE model to simulate the VF response using a continuum damage model 
      under compression and flexion loading conditions. A feasibility study is 
      presented to demonstrate the applicability of digital twins generated using this 
      AI-assisted framework to predict the risk of VF in a cancer patient with spinal 
      metastasis.

TI  - scDrugPrio: a framework for the analysis of single-cell transcriptomics to 
      address multiple problems in precision medicine in immune-mediated inflammatory 
      diseases.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s13073-024-01314-7 [doi]
LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ineffective drug treatment is a major problem for many patients with 
      immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Important reasons are the lack of 
      systematic solutions for drug prioritisation and repurposing based on 
      characterisation of the complex and heterogeneous cellular and molecular changes 
      in IMIDs. METHODS: Here, we propose a computational framework, scDrugPrio, which 
      constructs network models of inflammatory disease based on single-cell RNA 
      sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scDrugPrio constructs detailed network models of 
      inflammatory diseases that integrate information on cell type-specific expression 
      changes, altered cellular crosstalk and pharmacological properties for the 
      selection and ranking of thousands of drugs. RESULTS: scDrugPrio was developed 
      using a mouse model of antigen-induced arthritis and validated by improved 
      precision/recall for approved drugs, as well as extensive in vitro, in vivo, and 
      in silico studies of drugs that were predicted, but not approved, for the studied 
      diseases. Next, scDrugPrio was applied to multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, 
      and psoriatic arthritis, further supporting scDrugPrio through prioritisation of 
      relevant and approved drugs. However, in contrast to the mouse model of 
      arthritis, great interindividual cellular and gene expression differences were 
      found in patients with the same diagnosis. Such differences could explain why 
      some patients did or did not respond to treatment. This explanation was supported 
      by the application of scDrugPrio to scRNA-seq data from eleven individual Crohn's 
      disease patients. The analysis showed great variations in drug predictions 
      between patients, for example, assigning a high rank to anti-TNF treatment in a 
      responder and a low rank in a nonresponder to that treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      propose a computational framework, scDrugPrio, for drug prioritisation based on 
      scRNA-seq of IMID disease. Application to individual patients indicates 
      scDrugPrio's potential for personalised network-based drug screening on 
      cellulome-, genome-, and drugome-wide scales. For this purpose, we made 
      scDrugPrio into an easy-to-use R package ( 
      https://github.com/SDTC-CPMed/scDrugPrio ).

TI  - Unlocking the Power of Benchmarking: Real-World-Time Data Analysis for Enhanced 
      Sarcoma Patient Outcomes.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15174395 [doi]
LID - 4395
AB  - Benchmarking is crucial for healthcare providers to enhance quality and 
      efficiency, notably for complex conditions like sarcomas. Multidisciplinary 
      teams/sarcoma boards (MDT/SBs) are vital in sarcoma management, but differences 
      in their processes can affect patient outcomes and treatment costs, despite 
      adherence to international guidelines. To address this issue, this study aimed to 
      compare two MDT/SBs and establish an interoperable digital platform, 
      Sarconnector(®), for real-time-world data assessment and automated analysis. The 
      study included 983 patients, 46.0% of whom female, with a median age of 58 years, 
      and 4.5% of patients presented with metastasis at diagnosis. Differences were 
      observed in the number of first-time presentations, follow-up presentations, 
      primary sarcomas, biopsies and chemotherapy indications between the two MDT/SB. 
      The results highlight the importance of benchmarking and utilizing a harmonized 
      data approach, such as the RWT approach provided by the Sarconnector(®), to 
      standardize and evaluate quality and cost metrics. By identifying areas of 
      improvement and making data-driven decisions on the meta-level, healthcare 
      providers can optimize resources and improve patient outcomes. In conclusion, 
      benchmarking with the RWT harmonized data approach provided by the 
      Sarconnector(®) can help healthcare providers improve the overall effectiveness 
      of the healthcare system and achieve better outcomes for their patients in terms 
      of both outcomes and costs.

TI  - Putting the Personalized Metabolic Avatar into Production: A Comparison between 
      Deep-Learning and Statistical Models for Weight Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/nu15051199 [doi]
LID - 1199
AB  - Nutrition is a cross-cutting sector in medicine, with a huge impact on health, 
      from cardiovascular disease to cancer. Employment of digital medicine in 
      nutrition relies on digital twins: digital replicas of human physiology 
      representing an emergent solution for prevention and treatment of many diseases. 
      In this context, we have already developed a data-driven model of metabolism, 
      called a "Personalized Metabolic Avatar" (PMA), using gated recurrent unit (GRU) 
      neural networks for weight forecasting. However, putting a digital twin into 
      production to make it available for users is a difficult task that as important 
      as model building. Among the principal issues, changes to data sources, models 
      and hyperparameters introduce room for error and overfitting and can lead to 
      abrupt variations in computational time. In this study, we selected the best 
      strategy for deployment in terms of predictive performance and computational 
      time. Several models, such as the Transformer model, recursive neural networks 
      (GRUs and long short-term memory networks) and the statistical SARIMAX model were 
      tested on ten users. PMAs based on GRUs and LSTM showed optimal and stable 
      predictive performances, with the lowest root mean squared errors (0.38 ± 
      0.16-0.39 ± 0.18) and acceptable computational times of the retraining phase 
      (12.7 ± 1.42 s-13.5 ± 3.60 s) for a production environment. While the Transformer 
      model did not bring a substantial improvement over RNNs in term of predictive 
      performance, it increased the computational time for both forecasting and 
      retraining by 40%. The SARIMAX model showed the worst performance in term of 
      predictive performance, though it had the best computational time. For all the 
      models considered, the extent of the data source was a negligible factor, and a 
      threshold was established for the number of time points needed for a successful 
      prediction.

TI  - Multi-level digital-twin models of pulmonary mechanics: correlation analysis of 
      3D CT lung volume and 2D Chest motion.
LID - 10.1088/2057-1976/ad8c47 [doi]
AB  - Creating multi-level digital-twin models for mechanical ventilation requires a 
      detailed estimation of regional lung volume. An accurate generic map between 2D 
      chest surface motion and 3D regional lung volume could provide improved 
      regionalisation and clinically acceptable estimates localising lung damage. This 
      work investigates the relationship between CT lung volumes and the forced vital 
      capacity (FVC) a surrogate of tidal volume proven linked to 2D chest motion. In 
      particular, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with U-Net architecture is 
      employed to build a lung segmentation model using a benchmark CT scan dataset. An 
      automated thresholding method is proposed for image morphology analysis to 
      improve model performance. Finally, the trained model is applied to an 
      independent CT dataset with FVC measurements for correlation analysis of CT lung 
      volume projection to lung recruitment capacity. Model training results show a 
      clear improvement of lung segmentation performance with the proposed automated 
      thresholding method compared to a typically suggested fixed value selection, 
      achieving accuracy greater than 95% for both training and independent validation 
      sets. The correlation analysis for 160 patients shows a good correlation 
      ofRsquared value of 0.73 between the proposed 2D volume projection and the FVC 
      value, which indicates a larger and denser projection of lung volume relative to 
      a greater FVC value and lung recruitable capacity. The overall results thus 
      validate the potential of using non-contact, non-invasive 2D measures to enable 
      regionalising lung mechanics models to equivalent 3D models with a generic map 
      based on the good correlation. The clinical impact of improved lung mechanics 
      digital twins due to regionalising the lung mechanics and volume to specific lung 
      regions could be very high in managing mechanical ventilation and diagnosing or 
      locating lung injury or dysfunction based on regular monitoring instead of 
      intermittent and invasive lung imaging modalities.

AB  - We present the application of ReconGAN, introduced in a previous study, for 
      simulating the vertebroplasty (VP) operation and its impact on the fracture 
      response of a vertebral body. ReconGAN consists of a Deep Convolutional 
      Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and a finite element based shape 
      optimization algorithm to virtually reconstruct the trabecular bone 
      microstructure. The VP procedure involves injecting shear-thinning liquid bone 
      cement through a needle in the trabecular region to reinforce a diseased or 
      fractured vertebra. To simulate this treatment modality, computational fluid 
      dynamics (CFD) is employed to predict the morphology of the injected cement 
      within the bone microstructure. A power-law equation is utilized to characterize 
      the non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) 
      bone cement during injection simulations. The CFD model is coupled with the 
      level-set method to simulate the motion of the interface separating bone cement 
      and bone marrow. After predicting the cement morphology, a data co-registration 
      algorithm is employed to transform the CFD model to a high-fidelity continuum 
      damage mechanics (CDM) finite element model of the augmented vertebra for 
      predicting the fracture response. A feasibility study is presented to demonstrate 
      the ability of this CFD-CDM framework to investigate the effect of VP on the 
      mechanical integrity of the vertebral body in a cancer patient with a lytic 
      metastatic tumor.

      (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and the complexity of human brain tissues cause the 
      brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images to present varying degrees of 
      noise, weak boundaries, and artifacts. Hence, improvements are made over the 
      fuzzy clustering algorithm. A brain image processing and brain disease diagnosis 
      prediction model is designed based on improved fuzzy clustering and HPU-Net 
      (Hybrid Pyramid U-Net Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation) to ensure the model 
      safety performance. Brain MRI images collected from a Hospital, are employed in 
      simulation experiments to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. 
      Moreover, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), FCM 
      (Fuzzy C-Means), LDCFCM (Local Density Clustering Fuzzy C-Means), and AFCM 
      (Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means) are included in simulation experiments for performance 
      comparison. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has more nodes, lower 
      energy consumption, and more stable changes than other models under the same 
      conditions. Regarding the overall network performance, the proposed algorithm can 
      complete the data transmission tasks the fastest, basically maintaining at about 
      4.5 s on average, which performs remarkably better than other models. A further 
      prediction performance analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm provides the 
      highest prediction accuracy for the Whole Tumor under DSC (Dice Similarity 
      Coefficient), reaching 0.936. Besides, its Jaccard coefficient is 0.845, proving 
      its superior segmentation accuracy over other models. In a word, the proposed 
      algorithm can provide higher accuracy, a more apparent denoising effect, and the 
      best segmentation and recognition effect than other models while ensuring energy 
      consumption. The results can provide an experimental basis for the feature 
      recognition and predictive diagnosis of brain images.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Health Inequities in Dietary Interventions on 
      Atherosclerosis: A Narrative Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu16162601 [doi]
LID - 2601
AB  - Poor diet is the top modifiable mortality risk factor globally, accounting for 11 
      million deaths annually with half being from diet-linked atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Yet, most of the world cannot afford a healthy 
      diet-as the hidden costs of the inadequate global food system total over USD 13 
      trillion annually-let alone the much more clinically, financially, and 
      ecologically costly and resource-intensive medical interventions required to 
      address the disease progression and acute complications of ASCVD. Yet, AI is 
      increasingly understood as a force multiplying revolutionary technology which may 
      catalyze multi-sector efforts in medicine and public health to better address 
      these significant health challenges. This novel narrative review seeks to provide 
      the first known overview of the state-of-the-art in clinical interventions and 
      public health policies in healthy diets for ASCVD, accelerated by health 
      equity-focused AI. It is written from the first-hand practitioner perspective to 
      provide greater relevance and applicability for health professionals and data 
      scientists. The review summarizes the emerging trends and leading use cases in 
      population health risk stratification and precision public health, AI 
      democratizing clinical diagnosis, digital twins in precision nutrition, and 
      AI-enabled culinary medicine as medical education and treatment. This review may, 
      therefore, help inform and advance the evidence-based foundation for more 
      clinically effective, financially efficient, and societally equitable dietary and 
      nutrition interventions for ASCVD.

TI  - SynTwin: A graph-based approach for predicting clinical outcomes using digital 
      twins derived from synthetic patients.
PG  - 96-107
AB  - The concept of a digital twin came from the engineering, industrial, and 
      manufacturing domains to create virtual objects or machines that could inform the 
      design and development of real objects. This idea is appealing for precision 
      medicine where digital twins of patients could help inform healthcare decisions. 
      We have developed a methodology for generating and using digital twins for 
      clinical outcome prediction. We introduce a new approach that combines synthetic 
      data and network science to create digital twins (i.e. SynTwin) for precision 
      medicine. First, our approach starts by estimating the distance between all 
      subjects based on their available features. Second, the distances are used to 
      construct a network with subjects as nodes and edges defining distance less than 
      the percolation threshold. Third, communities or cliques of subjects are defined. 
      Fourth, a large population of synthetic patients are generated using a synthetic 
      data generation algorithm that models the correlation structure of the data to 
      generate new patients. Fifth, digital twins are selected from the synthetic 
      patient population that are within a given distance defining a subject community 
      in the network. Finally, we compare and contrast community-based prediction of 
      clinical endpoints using real subjects, digital twins, or both within and outside 
      of the community. Key to this approach are the digital twins defined using 
      patient similarity that represent hypothetical unobserved patients with patterns 
      similar to nearby real patients as defined by network distance and community 
      structure. We apply our SynTwin approach to predicting mortality in a 
      population-based cancer registry (n=87,674) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
      and End Results (SEER) program from the National Cancer Institute (USA). Our 
      results demonstrate that nearest network neighbor prediction of mortality in this 
      study is significantly improved with digital twins (AUROC=0.864, 95% 
      CI=0.857-0.872) over just using real data alone (AUROC=0.791, 95% 
      CI=0.781-0.800). These results suggest a network-based digital twin strategy 
      using synthetic patients may add value to precision medicine efforts.

TI  - Realization of digital twin for dynamic control toward sample variation of ion 
      exchange chromatography in antibody separation.
PG  - 1702-1715
LID - 10.1002/bit.28660 [doi]
AB  - Digital twin (DT) is a virtual and digital representation of physical objects or 
      processes. In this paper, this concept is applied to dynamic control of the 
      collection window in the ion exchange chromatography (IEC) toward sample 
      variations. A possible structure of a feedforward model-based control DT system 
      was proposed. Initially, a precise IEC mechanistic model was established through 
      experiments, model fitting, and validation. The average root mean square error 
      (RMSE) of fitting and validation was 8.1% and 7.4%, respectively. Then a 
      model-based gradient optimization was performed, resulting in a 70.0% yield with 
      a remarkable 11.2% increase. Subsequently, the DT was established by 
      systematically integrating the model, chromatography system, online 
      high-performance liquid chromatography, and a server computer. The DT was 
      validated under varying load conditions. The results demonstrated that the DT 
      could offer an accurate control with acidic variants proportion and yield 
      difference of less than 2% compared to the offline analysis. The embedding 
      mechanistic model also showed a positive predictive performance with an average 
      RMSE of 11.7% during the DT test under >10% sample variation. Practical scenario 
      tests indicated that tightening the control target could further enhance the DT 
      robustness, achieving over 98% success rate with an average yield of 72.7%. The 
      results demonstrated that the constructed DT could accurately mimic real-world 
      situations and perform an automated and flexible pooling in IEC. Additionally, a 
      detailed methodology for applying DT was summarized.

TI  - Organomics: A Concept Reflecting the Importance of PET/CT Healthy Organ Radiomics 
      in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Prognosis Prediction Using Machine Learning.
PG  - 899-908
LID - 10.1097/RLU.0000000000005400 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common subtype of lung cancer. 
      Patient survival prediction using machine learning (ML) and radiomics analysis 
      proved to provide promising outcomes. However, most studies reported in the 
      literature focused on information extracted from malignant lesions. This study 
      aims to explore the relevance and additional value of information extracted from 
      healthy organs in addition to tumoral tissue using ML algorithms. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: This study included PET/CT images of 154 patients collected from 
      available online databases. The gross tumor volume and 33 volumes of interest 
      defined on healthy organs were segmented using nnU-Net deep learning-based 
      segmentation. Subsequently, 107 radiomic features were extracted from PET and CT 
      images (Organomics). Clinical information was combined with PET and CT radiomics 
      from organs and gross tumor volumes considering 19 different combinations of 
      inputs. Finally, different feature selection (FS; 5 methods) and ML (6 
      algorithms) algorithms were tested in a 3-fold data split cross-validation 
      scheme. The performance of the models was quantified in terms of the concordance 
      index (C-index) metric. RESULTS: For an input combination of all radiomics 
      information, most of the selected features belonged to PET Organomics and CT 
      Organomics. The highest C-index (0.68) was achieved using univariate C-index FS 
      method and random survival forest ML model using CT Organomics + PET Organomics 
      as input as well as minimum depth FS method and CoxPH ML model using PET 
      Organomics as input. Considering all 17 combinations with C-index higher than 
      0.65, Organomics from PET or CT images were used as input in 16 of them. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The selected features and C-indices demonstrated that the additional 
      information extracted from healthy organs of both PET and CT imaging modalities 
      improved the ML performance. Organomics could be a step toward exploiting the 
      whole information available from multimodality medical images, contributing to 
      the emerging field of digital twins in health care.

AB  - Mathematical modeling in oncology has a long history. Recently, mathematical 
      models and their predictions have made inroads into prospective clinical trials 
      with encouraging results. The goal of many such modeling efforts is to make 
      predictions, either to clinician's choice therapy or into "optimal" therapy - 
      often for individual patients. The mathematical oncology community rightfully 
      puts great hope into predictive modeling and mechanistic digital twins - but with 
      this great opportunity comes great responsibility. Mathematical models need to be 
      rigorously calibrated and validated, and their predictive performance 
      ascertained, before conclusions about predictions into the unknown can be drawn. 
      The recent article "Modeling tumor growth using fractal calculus: Insights into 
      tumor dynamics" (Golmankhaneh et al., 2023), applied fractal calculus to tumor 
      growth data. In this short commentary, I raise concerns about the study design 
      and interpretation. In its current form, this study is poised to put cancer 
      patients at risk if interpreted as concluded by the authors.

TI  - Combined use of 3D printing and mixed reality technology for neurosurgical 
      training: getting ready for brain surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Learning surgical skills is an essential part of neurosurgical 
      training. Ideally, these skills are acquired to a sufficient extent in an ex vivo 
      setting. The authors previously described an in vitro brain tumor model, 
      consisting of a cadaveric animal brain injected with fluorescent agar-agar, for 
      acquiring a wide range of basic neuro-oncological skills. This model focused on 
      haptic skills such as safe tissue ablation technique and the training of 
      fluorescence-based resection. As important didactical technologies such as mixed 
      reality and 3D printing become more readily available, the authors developed a 
      readily available training model that integrates the haptic aspects into a mixed 
      reality setup. METHODS: The anatomical structures of a brain tumor patient were 
      segmented from medical imaging data to create a digital twin of the case. Bony 
      structures were 3D printed and combined with the in vitro brain tumor model. The 
      segmented structures were visualized in mixed reality headsets, and the 
      congruence of the printed and the virtual objects allowed them to be spatially 
      superimposed. In this way, users of the system were able to train on the entire 
      treatment process from surgery planning to instrument preparation and execution 
      of the surgery. RESULTS: Mixed reality visualization in the joint model 
      facilitated model (patient) positioning as well as craniotomy and the extent of 
      resection planning respecting case-dependent specifications. The advanced 
      physical model allowed brain tumor surgery training including skin incision; 
      craniotomy; dural opening; fluorescence-guided tumor resection; and dura, bone, 
      and skin closure. CONCLUSIONS: Combining mixed reality visualization with the 
      corresponding 3D printed physical hands-on model allowed advanced training of 
      sequential brain tumor resection skills. Three-dimensional printing technology 
      facilitates the production of a precise, reproducible, and worldwide accessible 
      brain tumor surgery model. The described model for brain tumor resection advanced 
      regarding important aspects of skills training for neurosurgical residents (e.g., 
      locating the lesion, head position planning, skull trepanation, dura opening, 
      tissue ablation techniques, fluorescence-guided resection, and closure). Mixed 
      reality enriches the model with important structures that are difficult to model 
      (e.g., vessels and fiber tracts) and advanced interaction concepts (e.g., 
      craniotomy simulations). Finally, this concept demonstrates a bridging technology 
      toward intraoperative application of mixed reality.

TI  - Simplification strategies for a patient-specific CFD model of particle transport 
      during liver radioembolization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-specific 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations 
      have been used previously to identify the impact of injection parameters (e.g. 
      injection location, velocity, etc.) on the particle distribution and the tumor 
      dose during transarterial injection of radioactive microspheres for treatment of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. However, these simulations are computationally costly, 
      so we aim to evaluate whether these can be reliably simplified. METHODS: We 
      identified and applied five simplification strategies (i.e. truncation, steady 
      flow modelling, moderate and severe grid coarsening, and reducing the number of 
      cardiac cycles) to a patient-specific CFD setup. Subsequently, we evaluated 
      whether these strategies can be used to (1) accurately predict the CFD output 
      (i.e. particle distribution and tumor dose) and (2) quantify the sensitivity of 
      the model output to a specific injection parameter (injection flow rate). 
      RESULTS: For both accuracy and sensitivity purposes, moderate grid coarsening is 
      the most reliable simplification strategy, allowing to predict the tumor dose 
      with only a maximal deviation of 1.4 %, and a similar sensitivity (deviation of 
      0.7 %). The steady strategy performs the worst, with a maximal deviation in the 
      tumor dose of 20 % and a difference in sensitivity of 10 %. CONCLUSION: The 
      patient-specific 3D CFD simulations of this study can be reliably simplified by 
      coarsening the grid, decreasing the computational time by roughly 45 %, which 
      works especially well for sensitivity studies.

TI  - Improving Sarcoma Outcomes: Target Trial Emulation to Compare the Impact of 
      Unplanned and Planned Resections on the Outcome.
LID - 10.3390/cancers16132443 [doi]
LID - 2443
AB  - This study follows the Target Trial Emulation (TTE) framework to assess the 
      impact of unplanned resections (UEs) and planned resections (PEs) of sarcomas on 
      local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), 
      cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Sarcomas, malignant 
      tumors with mesenchymal differentiation, present a significant clinical challenge 
      due to their rarity, complexity, and the frequent occurrence of UEs, which 
      complicates effective management. Our analysis utilized real-world-time data from 
      the Swiss Sarcoma Network, encompassing 429 patients, to compare the impact of 
      UEs and PEs, adjusting for known prognostic factors through a multivariable Cox 
      regression model and propensity score weighting. Our findings reveal a 
      significantly higher risk of local recurrence for UEs and a short-term follow-up 
      period that showed no marked differences in MFS, CSS, and OS between the UE and 
      PE groups, underlining the importance of optimal initial surgical management. 
      Furthermore, tumor grade was validated as a critical prognostic factor, 
      influencing outcomes irrespective of surgical strategy. This study illuminates 
      the need for improved referral systems to specialized sarcoma networks to prevent 
      UEs and advocates for the integration of TTE in sarcoma research to enhance 
      clinical guidelines and decision-making in sarcoma care. Future research should 
      focus on the prospective validations of these findings and the exploration of 
      integrated care models to reduce the incidence of UEs and improve patient 
      outcomes.
